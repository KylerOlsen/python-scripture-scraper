    <h2 id="section-1" class="chapter-title">Section 1</h2>
    <p id="section-1_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have decreed in them shall be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And verily I say unto you, that they who go forth, bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to seal both on earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God shall be poured out upon the wicked without measure—</p>
    <p id="section-1_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every man according to his work, and measure to every man according to the measure which he has measured to his fellow man.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear:</p>
    <p id="section-1_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets—</p>
    <p id="section-1_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh—</p>
    <p id="section-1_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>That faith also might increase in the earth;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>That mine everlasting covenant might be established;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power to translate through the mercy of God, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individually—</p>
    <p id="section-1_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And he that repents not, from him shall be taken even the light which he has received; for my Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the Lord of Hosts.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth: I the Lord am willing to make these things known unto all flesh;</p>
    <p id="section-1_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</p>
    <p id="section-1_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-3" class="chapter-title">Section 3</h2>
    <p id="section-3_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>The works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath said, therefore his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Remember, remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men;</p>
    <p id="section-3_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Behold, you have been entrusted with these things, but how strict were your commandments; and remember also the promises which were made to you, if you did not transgress them.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And behold, how oft you have transgressed the commandments and the laws of God, and have gone on in the persuasions of men.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and despise his words—</p>
    <p id="section-3_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Yet you should have been faithful; and he would have extended his arm and supported you against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been with you in every time of trouble.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Behold, thou art Joseph, and thou wast chosen to do the work of the Lord, but because of transgression, if thou art not aware thou wilt fall.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>But remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that which thou hast done which is contrary to the commandment which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, and art again called to the work;</p>
    <p id="section-3_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Except thou do this, thou shalt be delivered up and become as other men, and have no more gift.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And when thou deliveredst up that which God had given thee sight and power to translate, thou deliveredst up that which was sacred into the hands of a wicked man,</p>
    <p id="section-3_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Who has set at naught the counsels of God, and has broken the most sacred promises which were made before God, and has depended upon his own judgment and boasted in his own wisdom.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And this is the reason that thou hast lost thy privileges for a season—</p>
    <p id="section-3_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>For thou hast suffered the counsel of thy director to be trampled upon from the beginning.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Nevertheless, my work shall go forth, for inasmuch as the knowledge of a Savior has come unto the world, through the testimony of the Jews, even so shall the knowledge of a Savior come unto my people—</p>
    <p id="section-3_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And to the Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the Josephites, and the Zoramites, through the testimony of their fathers—</p>
    <p id="section-3_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And this testimony shall come to the knowledge of the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who dwindled in unbelief because of the iniquity of their fathers, whom the Lord has suffered to destroy their brethren the Nephites, because of their iniquities and their abominations.</p>
    <p id="section-3_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And for this very purpose are these plates preserved, which contain these records—that the promises of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he made to his people;</p>
    <p id="section-3_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And that the Lamanites might come to the knowledge of their fathers, and that they might know the promises of the Lord, and that they may believe the gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be glorified through faith in his name, and that through their repentance they might be saved. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-4" class="chapter-title">Section 4</h2>
    <p id="section-4_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.</p>
    <p id="section-4_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</p>
    <p id="section-4_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work;</p>
    <p id="section-4_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul;</p>
    <p id="section-4_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work.</p>

    <h2 id="section-5" class="chapter-title">Section 5</h2>
    <p id="section-5_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Behold, I say unto you, that as my servant Martin Harris has desired a witness at my hand, that you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., have got the plates of which you have testified and borne record that you have received of me;</p>
    <p id="section-5_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And now, behold, this shall you say unto him—he who spake unto you, said unto you: I, the Lord, am God, and have given these things unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and have commanded you that you should stand as a witness of these things;</p>
    <p id="section-5_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And I have caused you that you should enter into a covenant with me, that you should not show them except to those persons to whom I commanded you; and you have no power over them except I grant it unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And you have a gift to translate the plates; and this is the first gift that I bestowed upon you; and I have commanded that you should pretend to no other gift until my purpose is fulfilled in this; for I will grant unto you no other gift until it is finished.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Verily, I say unto you, that woe shall come unto the inhabitants of the earth if they will not hearken unto my words;</p>
    <p id="section-5_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>For hereafter you shall be ordained and go forth and deliver my words unto the children of men.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Behold, if they will not believe my words, they would not believe you, my servant Joseph, if it were possible that you should show them all these things which I have committed unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Oh, this unbelieving and stiffnecked generation—mine anger is kindled against them.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Behold, verily I say unto you, I have reserved those things which I have entrusted unto you, my servant Joseph, for a wise purpose in me, and it shall be made known unto future generations;</p>
    <p id="section-5_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>But this generation shall have my word through you;</p>
    <p id="section-5_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And in addition to your testimony, the testimony of three of my servants, whom I shall call and ordain, unto whom I will show these things, and they shall go forth with my words that are given through you.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Yea, they shall know of a surety that these things are true, for from heaven will I declare it unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>I will give them power that they may behold and view these things as they are;</p>
    <p id="section-5_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And to none else will I grant this power, to receive this same testimony among this generation, in this the beginning of the rising up and the coming forth of my church out of the wilderness—clear as the moon, and fair as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And the testimony of three witnesses will I send forth of my word.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And behold, whosoever believeth on my words, them will I visit with the manifestation of my Spirit; and they shall be born of me, even of water and of the Spirit—</p>
    <p id="section-5_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And you must wait yet a little while, for ye are not yet ordained—</p>
    <p id="section-5_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And their testimony shall also go forth unto the condemnation of this generation if they harden their hearts against them;</p>
    <p id="section-5_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>For a desolating scourge shall go forth among the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured out from time to time, if they repent not, until the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Behold, I tell you these things, even as I also told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem; and my word shall be verified at this time as it hath hitherto been verified.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And now I command you, my servant Joseph, to repent and walk more uprightly before me, and to yield to the persuasions of men no more;</p>
    <p id="section-5_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And that you be firm in keeping the commandments wherewith I have commanded you; and if you do this, behold I grant unto you eternal life, even if you should be slain.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And now, again, I speak unto you, my servant Joseph, concerning the man that desires the witness—</p>
    <p id="section-5_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Behold, I say unto him, he exalts himself and does not humble himself sufficiently before me; but if he will bow down before me, and humble himself in mighty prayer and faith, in the sincerity of his heart, then will I grant unto him a view of the things which he desires to see.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And then he shall say unto the people of this generation: Behold, I have seen the things which the Lord hath shown unto Joseph Smith, Jun., and I know of a surety that they are true, for I have seen them, for they have been shown unto me by the power of God and not of man.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And I the Lord command him, my servant Martin Harris, that he shall say no more unto them concerning these things, except he shall say: I have seen them, and they have been shown unto me by the power of God; and these are the words which he shall say.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>But if he deny this he will break the covenant which he has before covenanted with me, and behold, he is condemned.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And now, except he humble himself and acknowledge unto me the things that he has done which are wrong, and covenant with me that he will keep my commandments, and exercise faith in me, behold, I say unto him, he shall have no such views, for I will grant unto him no views of the things of which I have spoken.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And if this be the case, I command you, my servant Joseph, that you shall say unto him, that he shall do no more, nor trouble me any more concerning this matter.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And if this be the case, behold, I say unto thee Joseph, when thou hast translated a few more pages thou shalt stop for a season, even until I command thee again; then thou mayest translate again.</p>
    <p id="section-5_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And except thou do this, behold, thou shalt have no more gift, and I will take away the things which I have entrusted with thee.</p>

    <p id="section-6_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>A great and marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of men.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Behold, I am God; give heed unto my word, which is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore give heed unto my words.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap, let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion;</p>
    <p id="section-6_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be unto you; and if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Say nothing but repentance unto this generation; keep my commandments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to my commandments, and you shall be blessed.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou because of thy gift. Remember it is sacred and cometh from above—</p>
    <p id="section-6_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And if thou wilt inquire, thou shalt know mysteries which are great and marvelous; therefore thou shalt exercise thy gift, that thou mayest find out mysteries, that thou mayest bring many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, convince them of the error of their ways.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Make not thy gift known unto any save it be those who are of thy faith. Trifle not with sacred things.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, blessed art thou for what thou hast done; for thou hast inquired of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit.

    <p id="section-6_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth;</p>
    <p id="section-6_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that there is none else save God that knowest thy thoughts and the intents of thy heart.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>I tell thee these things as a witness unto thee—that the words or the work which thou hast been writing are true.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word’s sake.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Admonish him in his faults, and also receive admonition of him. Be patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience, faith, hope and charity.</p>

    <p id="section-6_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?</p>
    <p id="section-6_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And now, behold, you have received a witness; for if I have told you things which no man knoweth have you not received a witness?</p>
    <p id="section-6_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And, behold, I grant unto you a gift, if you desire of me, to translate, even as my servant Joseph.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that there are records which contain much of my gospel, which have been kept back because of the wickedness of the people;</p>
    <p id="section-6_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And now I command you, that if you have good desires—a desire to lay up treasures for yourself in heaven—then shall you assist in bringing to light, with your gift, those parts of my scriptures which have been hidden because of iniquity.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And now, behold, I give unto you, and also unto my servant Joseph, the keys of this gift, which shall bring to light this ministry; and in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if they reject my words, and this part of my gospel and ministry, blessed are ye, for they can do no more unto you than unto me.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And even if they do unto you even as they have done unto me, blessed are ye, for you shall dwell with me in glory.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>But if they reject not my words, which shall be established by the testimony which shall be given, blessed are they, and then shall ye have joy in the fruit of your labors.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto my disciples, where two or three are gathered together in my name, as touching one thing, behold, there will I be in the midst of them—even so am I in the midst of you.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways and sin no more; perform with soberness the work which I have commanded you.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.</p>
    <p id="section-6_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-8_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</p>

    <p id="section-9_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Behold, I say unto you, my son, that because you did not translate according to that which you desired of me, and did commence again to write for my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that ye should continue until you have finished this record, which I have entrusted unto him.</p>
    <p id="section-9_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And then, behold, other records have I, that I will give unto you power that you may assist to translate.</p>
    <p id="section-9_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Be patient, my son, for it is wisdom in me, and it is not expedient that you should translate at this present time.</p>
    <p id="section-9_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Behold, the work which you are called to do is to write for my servant Joseph.</p>
    <p id="section-9_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you.</p>
    <p id="section-9_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner.</p>
    <p id="section-9_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</p>
    <p id="section-9_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</p>
    <p id="section-9_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.</p>

    <p id="section-10_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, wo be unto him that lieth to deceive because he supposeth that another lieth to deceive, for such are not exempt from the justice of God.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Now, behold, they have altered these words, because Satan saith unto them: He hath deceived you—and thus he flattereth them away to do iniquity, to get thee to tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Behold, I say unto you, that you shall not translate again those words which have gone forth out of your hands;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>For, behold, they shall not accomplish their evil designs in lying against those words. For, behold, if you should bring forth the same words they will say that you have lied and that you have pretended to translate, but that you have contradicted yourself.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And, behold, they will publish this, and Satan will harden the hearts of the people to stir them up to anger against you, that they will not believe my words.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Thus Satan thinketh to overpower your testimony in this generation, that the work may not come forth in this generation.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>But behold, here is wisdom, and because I show unto you wisdom, and give you commandments concerning these things, what you shall do, show it not unto the world until you have accomplished the work of translation.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Marvel not that I said unto you: Here is wisdom, show it not unto the world—for I said, show it not unto the world, that you may be preserved.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Behold, I do not say that you shall not show it unto the righteous;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>But as you cannot always judge the righteous, or as you cannot always tell the wicked from the righteous, therefore I say unto you, hold your peace until I shall see fit to make all things known unto the world concerning the matter.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, that an account of those things that you have written, which have gone out of your hands, is engraven upon the plates of Nephi;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Yea, and you remember it was said in those writings that a more particular account was given of these things upon the plates of Nephi.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And now, because the account which is engraven upon the plates of Nephi is more particular concerning the things which, in my wisdom, I would bring to the knowledge of the people in this account—</p>
    <p id="section-10_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Therefore, you shall translate the engravings which are on the plates of Nephi, down even till you come to the reign of king Benjamin, or until you come to that which you have translated, which you have retained;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And behold, you shall publish it as the record of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have altered my words.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>I will not suffer that they shall destroy my work; yea, I will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>Behold, they have only got a part, or an abridgment of the account of Nephi.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Behold, there are many things engraven upon the plates of Nephi which do throw greater views upon my gospel; therefore, it is wisdom in me that you should translate this first part of the engravings of Nephi, and send forth in this work.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And, behold, all the remainder of this work does contain all those parts of my gospel which my holy prophets, yea, and also my disciples, desired in their prayers should come forth unto this people.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And I said unto them, that it should be granted unto them according to their faith in their prayers;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>Yea, and this was their faith—that my gospel, which I gave unto them that they might preach in their days, might come unto their brethren the Lamanites, and also all that had become Lamanites because of their dissensions.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>Now, this is not all—their faith in their prayers was that this gospel should be made known also, if it were possible that other nations should possess this land;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And thus they did leave a blessing upon this land in their prayers, that whosoever should believe in this gospel in this land might have eternal life;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>Yea, that it might be free unto all of whatsoever nation, kindred, tongue, or people they may be.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And now, behold, according to their faith in their prayers will I bring this part of my gospel to the knowledge of my people. Behold, I do not bring it to destroy that which they have received, but to build it up.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>And for this cause have I said: If this generation harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>Now I do not say this to destroy my church, but I say this to build up my church;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>Therefore, whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear, for such shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>But it is they who do not fear me, neither keep my commandments but build up churches unto themselves to get gain, yea, and all those that do wickedly and build up the kingdom of the devil—yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that it is they that I will disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to the center.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I came unto mine own, and mine own received me not.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>I am the light which shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>I am he who said—Other sheep have I which are not of this fold—unto my disciples, and many there were that understood me not.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>And I will show unto this people that I had other sheep, and that they were a branch of the house of Jacob;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>And I will bring to light their marvelous works, which they did in my name;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>Yea, and I will also bring to light my gospel which was ministered unto them, and, behold, they shall not deny that which you have received, but they shall build it up, and shall bring to light the true points of my doctrine, yea, and the only doctrine which is in me.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>And this I do that I may establish my gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these things they do err, for they do wrest the scriptures and do not understand them.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>Therefore, I will unfold unto them this great mystery;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>For, behold, I will gather them as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if they will not harden their hearts;</p>
    <p id="section-10_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>Yea, if they will come, they may, and partake of the waters of life freely.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>Behold, this is my doctrine—whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me, the same is my church.</p>
    <p id="section-10_v68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me; therefore he is not of my church.</p>

    <p id="section-17_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Behold, I say unto you, that you must rely upon my word, which if you do with full purpose of heart, you shall have a view of the plates, and also of the breastplate, the sword of Laban, the Urim and Thummim, which were given to the brother of Jared upon the mount, when he talked with the Lord face to face, and the miraculous directors which were given to Lehi while in the wilderness, on the borders of the Red Sea.</p>
    <p id="section-17_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And it is by your faith that you shall obtain a view of them, even by that faith which was had by the prophets of old.</p>
    <p id="section-17_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And after that you have obtained faith, and have seen them with your eyes, you shall testify of them, by the power of God;</p>
    <p id="section-17_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And this you shall do that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may not be destroyed, that I may bring about my righteous purposes unto the children of men in this work.</p>

    <h2 id="section-18" class="chapter-title">Section 18</h2>
    <p id="section-18_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now, behold, because of the thing which you, my servant Oliver Cowdery, have desired to know of me, I give unto you these words:</p>
    <p id="section-18_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Behold, I have manifested unto you, by my Spirit in many instances, that the things which you have written are true; wherefore you know that they are true.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And if you know that they are true, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that you rely upon the things which are written;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For in them are all things written concerning the foundation of my church, my gospel, and my rock.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Wherefore, if you shall build up my church, upon the foundation of my gospel and my rock, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Behold, the world is ripening in iniquity; and it must needs be that the children of men are stirred up unto repentance, both the Gentiles and also the house of Israel.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Wherefore, as thou hast been baptized by the hands of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., according to that which I have commanded him, he hath fulfilled the thing which I commanded him.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And now, marvel not that I have called him unto mine own purpose, which purpose is known in me; wherefore, if he shall be diligent in keeping my commandments he shall be blessed unto eternal life; and his name is Joseph.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And now, Oliver Cowdery, I speak unto you, and also unto David Whitmer, by the way of commandment; for, behold, I command all men everywhere to repent, and I speak unto you, even as unto Paul mine apostle, for you are called even with that same calling with which he was called.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!</p>
    <p id="section-18_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!</p>
    <p id="section-18_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!</p>
    <p id="section-18_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Behold, you have my gospel before you, and my rock, and my salvation.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Ask the Father in my name in faith, believing that you shall receive, and you shall have the Holy Ghost, which manifesteth all things which are expedient unto the children of men.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And if you have not faith, hope, and charity, you can do nothing.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Contend against no church, save it be the church of the devil.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Take upon you the name of Christ, and speak the truth in soberness.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And as many as repent and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and endure to the end, the same shall be saved.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Behold, Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father, and there is none other name given whereby man can be saved;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Wherefore, all men must take upon them the name which is given of the Father, for in that name shall they be called at the last day;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Wherefore, if they know not the name by which they are called, they cannot have place in the kingdom of my Father.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And now, behold, there are others who are called to declare my gospel, both unto Gentile and unto Jew;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Yea, even twelve; and the Twelve shall be my disciples, and they shall take upon them my name; and the Twelve are they who shall desire to take upon them my name with full purpose of heart.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And if they desire to take upon them my name with full purpose of heart, they are called to go into all the world to preach my gospel unto every creature.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And they are they who are ordained of me to baptize in my name, according to that which is written;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And you have that which is written before you; wherefore, you must perform it according to the words which are written.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And now I speak unto you, the Twelve—Behold, my grace is sufficient for you; you must walk uprightly before me and sin not.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And, behold, you are they who are ordained of me to ordain priests and teachers; to declare my gospel, according to the power of the Holy Ghost which is in you, and according to the callings and gifts of God unto men;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God, have spoken it.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and not of man;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; and save it were by my power you could not have them;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And now, behold, I give unto you, Oliver Cowdery, and also unto David Whitmer, that you shall search out the Twelve, who shall have the desires of which I have spoken;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And by their desires and their works you shall know them.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And when you have found them you shall show these things unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And you shall fall down and worship the Father in my name.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And you must preach unto the world, saying: You must repent and be baptized, in the name of Jesus Christ;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>For all men must repent and be baptized, and not only men, but women, and children who have arrived at the years of accountability.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And now, after that you have received this, you must keep my commandments in all things;</p>
    <p id="section-18_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And by your hands I will work a marvelous work among the children of men, unto the convincing of many of their sins, that they may come unto repentance, and that they may come unto the kingdom of my Father.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Wherefore, the blessings which I give unto you are above all things.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And after that you have received this, if you keep not my commandments you cannot be saved in the kingdom of my Father.</p>
    <p id="section-18_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Behold, I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God, and your Redeemer, by the power of my Spirit have spoken it. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-19" class="chapter-title">Section 19</h2>
    <p id="section-19_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>I am Alpha and Omega, Christ the Lord; yea, even I am he, the beginning and the end, the Redeemer of the world.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>I, having accomplished and finished the will of him whose I am, even the Father, concerning me—having done this that I might subdue all things unto myself—</p>
    <p id="section-19_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Retaining all power, even to the destroying of Satan and his works at the end of the world, and the last great day of judgment, which I shall pass upon the inhabitants thereof, judging every man according to his works and the deeds which he hath done.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And surely every man must repent or suffer, for I, God, am endless.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Wherefore, I revoke not the judgments which I shall pass, but woes shall go forth, weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, yea, to those who are found on my left hand.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Nevertheless, it is not written that there shall be no end to this torment, but it is written <em>endless torment.</em></p>
    <p id="section-19_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Again, it is written <em>eternal damnation;</em> wherefore it is more express than other scriptures, that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men, altogether for my name’s glory.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Wherefore, I will explain unto you this mystery, for it is meet unto you to know even as mine apostles.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing, even as one, that you may enter into my rest.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>For, behold, the mystery of godliness, how great is it! For, behold, I am endless, and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless punishment, for Endless is my name. Wherefore—</p>
    <p id="section-19_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Eternal punishment is God’s punishment.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Endless punishment is God’s punishment.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Wherefore, I command you to repent, and keep the commandments which you have received by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., in my name;</p>
    <p id="section-19_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And it is by my almighty power that you have received them;</p>
    <p id="section-19_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Therefore I command you to repent—repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore—how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</p>
    <p id="section-19_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</p>
    <p id="section-19_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink—</p>
    <p id="section-19_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I humble you with my almighty power; and that you confess your sins, lest you suffer these punishments of which I have spoken, of which in the smallest, yea, even in the least degree you have tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And I command you that you preach naught but repentance, and show not these things unto the world until it is wisdom in me.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>For they cannot bear meat now, but milk they must receive; wherefore, they must not know these things, lest they perish.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>I am Jesus Christ; I came by the will of the Father, and I do his will.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And again, I command thee that thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife; nor seek thy neighbor’s life.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And again, I command thee that thou shalt not covet thine own property, but impart it freely to the printing of the Book of Mormon, which contains the truth and the word of God—</p>
    <p id="section-19_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Which is my word to the Gentile, that soon it may go to the Jew, of whom the Lamanites are a remnant, that they may believe the gospel, and look not for a Messiah to come who has already come.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And again, I command thee that thou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as in private.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And thou shalt declare glad tidings, yea, publish it upon the mountains, and upon every high place, and among every people that thou shalt be permitted to see.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And thou shalt do it with all humility, trusting in me, reviling not against revilers.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And of tenets thou shalt not talk, but thou shalt declare repentance and faith on the Savior, and remission of sins by baptism, and by fire, yea, even the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Behold, this is a great and the last commandment which I shall give unto you concerning this matter; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk, even unto the end of thy life.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And misery thou shalt receive if thou wilt slight these counsels, yea, even the destruction of thyself and property.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Impart a portion of thy property, yea, even part of thy lands, and all save the support of thy family.</p>

    <p id="section-19_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Leave thy house and home, except when thou shalt desire to see thy family;</p>
    <p id="section-19_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And speak freely to all; yea, preach, exhort, declare the truth, even with a loud voice, with a sound of rejoicing, crying—Hosanna, hosanna, blessed be the name of the Lord God!</p>
    <p id="section-19_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing—yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof.</p>
    <p id="section-19_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Behold, canst thou read this without rejoicing and lifting up thy heart for gladness?</p>
    <p id="section-19_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>Or canst thou run about longer as a blind guide?</p>
    <p id="section-19_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Or canst thou be humble and meek, and conduct thyself wisely before me? Yea, come unto me thy Savior. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-20_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April—</p>

    <p id="section-24_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Behold, thou wast called and chosen to write the Book of Mormon, and to my ministry; and I have lifted thee up out of thine afflictions, and have counseled thee, that thou hast been delivered from all thine enemies, and thou hast been delivered from the powers of Satan and from darkness!</p>
    <p id="section-24_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Nevertheless, thou art not excusable in thy transgressions; nevertheless, go thy way and sin no more.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Magnify thine office; and after thou hast sowed thy fields and secured them, go speedily unto the church which is in Colesville, Fayette, and Manchester, and they shall support thee; and I will bless them both spiritually and temporally;</p>
    <p id="section-24_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>But if they receive thee not, I will send upon them a cursing instead of a blessing.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And thou shalt continue in calling upon God in my name, and writing the things which shall be given thee by the Comforter, and expounding all scriptures unto the church.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And it shall be given thee in the very moment what thou shalt speak and write, and they shall hear it, or I will send unto them a cursing instead of a blessing.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>For thou shalt devote all thy service in Zion; and in this thou shalt have strength.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And in temporal labors thou shalt not have strength, for this is not thy calling. Attend to thy calling and thou shalt have wherewith to magnify thine office, and to expound all scriptures, and continue in laying on of the hands and confirming the churches.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And thy brother Oliver shall continue in bearing my name before the world, and also to the church. And he shall not suppose that he can say enough in my cause; and lo, I am with him to the end.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>In me he shall have glory, and not of himself, whether in weakness or in strength, whether in bonds or free;</p>
    <p id="section-24_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And at all times, and in all places, he shall open his mouth and declare my gospel as with the voice of a trump, both day and night. And I will give unto him strength such as is not known among men.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Require not miracles, except I shall command you, except casting out devils, healing the sick, and against poisonous serpents, and against deadly poisons;</p>
    <p id="section-24_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And these things ye shall not do, except it be required of you by them who desire it, that the scriptures might be fulfilled; for ye shall do according to that which is written.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And in whatsoever place ye shall enter, and they receive you not in my name, ye shall leave a cursing instead of a blessing, by casting off the dust of your feet against them as a testimony, and cleansing your feet by the wayside.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall lay their hands upon you by violence, ye shall command to be smitten in my name; and, behold, I will smite them according to your words, in mine own due time.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And whosoever shall go to law with thee shall be cursed by the law.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And thou shalt take no purse nor scrip, neither staves, neither two coats, for the church shall give unto thee in the very hour what thou needest for food and for raiment, and for shoes and for money, and for scrip.</p>
    <p id="section-24_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>For thou art called to prune my vineyard with a mighty pruning, yea, even for the last time; yea, and also all those whom thou hast ordained, and they shall do even according to this pattern. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-27_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, that you shall not purchase wine neither strong drink of your enemies;</p>

    <p id="section-28_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>For I have given him the keys of the mysteries, and the revelations which are sealed, until I shall appoint unto them another in his stead.</p>
    <p id="section-28_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And now, behold, I say unto you that you shall go unto the Lamanites and preach my gospel unto them; and inasmuch as they receive thy teachings thou shalt cause my church to be established among them; and thou shalt have revelations, but write them not by way of commandment.</p>
    <p id="section-28_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And now, behold, I say unto you that it is not revealed, and no man knoweth where the city Zion shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter. Behold, I say unto you that it shall be on the borders by the Lamanites.</p>

    <p id="section-29_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And the righteous shall be gathered on my right hand unto eternal life; and the wicked on my left hand will I be ashamed to own before the Father;</p>
    <p id="section-29_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Wherefore I will say unto them—Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And now, behold, I say unto you, never at any time have I declared from mine own mouth that they should return, for where I am they cannot come, for they have no power.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>But remember that all my judgments are not given unto men; and as the words have gone forth out of my mouth even so shall they be fulfilled, that the first shall be last, and that the last shall be first in all things whatsoever I have created by the word of my power, which is the power of my Spirit.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>For by the power of my Spirit created I them; yea, all things both spiritual and temporal—</p>
    <p id="section-29_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>First spiritual, secondly temporal, which is the beginning of my work; and again, first temporal, and secondly spiritual, which is the last of my work—</p>
    <p id="section-29_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Speaking unto you that you may naturally understand; but unto myself my works have no end, neither beginning; but it is given unto you that ye may understand, because ye have asked it of me and are agreed.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And it came to pass that Adam, being tempted of the devil—for, behold, the devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency;</p>
    <p id="section-29_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels;</p>
    <p id="section-29_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And, behold, there is a place prepared for them from the beginning, which place is hell.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet—</p>
    <p id="section-29_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>Wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook of the forbidden fruit and transgressed the commandment, wherein he became subject to the will of the devil, because he yielded unto temptation.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be cast out from the Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye cursed.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>But, behold, I say unto you that I, the Lord God, gave unto Adam and unto his seed, that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I, the Lord God, should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and redemption, through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation—that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life, even as many as would believe;</p>
    <p id="section-29_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And they that believe not unto eternal damnation; for they cannot be redeemed from their spiritual fall, because they repent not;</p>
    <p id="section-29_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>For they love darkness rather than light, and their deeds are evil, and they receive their wages of whom they list to obey.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>But behold, I say unto you, that little children are redeemed from the foundation of the world through mine Only Begotten;</p>
    <p id="section-29_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Wherefore, they cannot sin, for power is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they begin to become accountable before me;</p>
    <p id="section-29_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>For it is given unto them even as I will, according to mine own pleasure, that great things may be required at the hand of their fathers.</p>
    <p id="section-29_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>And, again, I say unto you, that whoso having knowledge, have I not commanded to repent?</p>
    <p id="section-29_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And he that hath no understanding, it remaineth in me to do according as it is written. And now I declare no more unto you at this time. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-38" class="chapter-title">Section 38</h2>
    <p id="section-38_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Thus saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, the Great <span class="small-caps">I Am</span>, Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the same which looked upon the wide expanse of eternity, and all the seraphic hosts of heaven, before the world was made;</p>
    <p id="section-38_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>The same which knoweth all things, for all things are present before mine eyes;</p>
    <p id="section-38_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>I am the same which spake, and the world was made, and all things came by me.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>I am the same which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own bosom; and verily, I say, even as many as have believed in my name, for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>But behold, the residue of the wicked have I kept in chains of darkness until the judgment of the great day, which shall come at the end of the earth;</p>

    <p id="section-38_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>But behold, verily, verily, I say unto you that mine eyes are upon you. I am in your midst and ye cannot see me;</p>
    <p id="section-38_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But the day soon cometh that ye shall see me, and know that I am; for the veil of darkness shall soon be rent, and he that is not purified shall not abide the day.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Wherefore, gird up your loins and be prepared. Behold, the kingdom is yours, and the enemy shall not overcome.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Verily I say unto you, ye are clean, but not all; and there is none else with whom I am well pleased;</p>
    <p id="section-38_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>For all flesh is corrupted before me; and the powers of darkness prevail upon the earth, among the children of men, in the presence of all the hosts of heaven—</p>
    <p id="section-38_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Which causeth silence to reign, and all eternity is pained, and the angels are waiting the great command to reap down the earth, to gather the tares that they may be burned; and, behold, the enemy is combined.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And now I show unto you a mystery, a thing which is had in secret chambers, to bring to pass even your destruction in process of time, and ye knew it not;</p>
    <p id="section-38_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But now I tell it unto you, and ye are blessed, not because of your iniquity, neither your hearts of unbelief; for verily some of you are guilty before me, but I will be merciful unto your weakness.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Therefore, be ye strong from henceforth; fear not, for the kingdom is yours.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And for your salvation I give unto you a commandment, for I have heard your prayers, and the poor have complained before me, and the rich have I made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter of persons.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And I have made the earth rich, and behold it is my footstool, wherefore, again I will stand upon it.</p>

    <p id="section-38_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And I will give it unto you for the land of your inheritance, if you seek it with all your hearts.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And this shall be my covenant with you, ye shall have it for the land of your inheritance, and for the inheritance of your children forever, while the earth shall stand, and ye shall possess it again in eternity, no more to pass away.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>But, verily I say unto you that in time ye shall have no king nor ruler, for I will be your king and watch over you.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Wherefore, hear my voice and follow me, and you shall be a free people, and ye shall have no laws but my laws when I come, for I am your lawgiver, and what can stay my hand?</p>
    <p id="section-38_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But, verily I say unto you, teach one another according to the office wherewith I have appointed you;</p>
    <p id="section-38_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practice virtue and holiness before me.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>For what man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of them, and they serve him obediently, and he saith unto the one: Be thou clothed in robes and sit thou here; and to the other: Be thou clothed in rags and sit thou there—and looketh upon his sons and saith I am just?</p>
    <p id="section-38_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Behold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am. I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And again, I say unto you that the enemy in the secret chambers seeketh your lives.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Ye hear of wars in far countries, and you say that there will soon be great wars in far countries, but ye know not the hearts of men in your own land.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, treasure up wisdom in your bosoms, lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in a manner which shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And that ye might escape the power of the enemy, and be gathered unto me a righteous people, without spot and blameless—</p>
    <p id="section-38_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Wherefore, for this cause I gave unto you the commandment that ye should go to the Ohio; and there I will give unto you my law; and there you shall be endowed with power from on high;</p>
    <p id="section-38_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And from thence, whosoever I will shall go forth among all nations, and it shall be told them what they shall do; for I have a great work laid up in store, for Israel shall be saved, and I will lead them whithersoever I will, and no power shall stay my hand.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And now, I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that certain men among them shall be appointed, and they shall be appointed by the voice of the church;</p>
    <p id="section-38_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And they shall look to the poor and the needy, and administer to their relief that they shall not suffer; and send them forth to the place which I have commanded them;</p>
    <p id="section-38_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And this shall be their work, to govern the affairs of the property of this church.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And they that have farms that cannot be sold, let them be left or rented as seemeth them good.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>See that all things are preserved; and when men are endowed with power from on high and sent forth, all these things shall be gathered unto the bosom of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And if ye seek the riches which it is the will of the Father to give unto you, ye shall be the richest of all people, for ye shall have the riches of eternity; and it must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment, that every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And let your preaching be the warning voice, every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in meekness.</p>
    <p id="section-38_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And go ye out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-41_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Hearken, O ye elders of my church whom I have called, behold I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall assemble yourselves together to agree upon my word;</p>

    <p id="section-41_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>For it is not meet that the things which belong to the children of the kingdom should be given to them that are not worthy, or to dogs, or the pearls to be cast before swine.</p>
    <p id="section-41_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And again, it is meet that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., should have a house built, in which to live and translate.</p>

    <h2 id="section-42" class="chapter-title">Section 42</h2>
    <p id="section-42_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves together in my name, even Jesus Christ the Son of the living God, the Savior of the world; inasmuch as ye believe on my name and keep my commandments.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Again I say unto you, hearken and hear and obey the law which I shall give unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>For verily I say, as ye have assembled yourselves together according to the commandment wherewith I commanded you, and are agreed as touching this one thing, and have asked the Father in my name, even so ye shall receive.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Behold, verily I say unto you, I give unto you this first commandment, that ye shall go forth in my name, every one of you, excepting my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And I give unto them a commandment that they shall go forth for a little season, and it shall be given by the power of the Spirit when they shall return.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And ye shall go forth baptizing with water, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And from this place ye shall go forth into the regions westward; and inasmuch as ye shall find them that will receive you ye shall build up my church in every region—</p>
    <p id="section-42_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Until the time shall come when it shall be revealed unto you from on high, when the city of the New Jerusalem shall be prepared, that ye may be gathered in one, that ye may be my people and I will be your God.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And again, I say unto you, that my servant Edward Partridge shall stand in the office whereunto I have appointed him. And it shall come to pass, that if he transgress another shall be appointed in his stead. Even so. Amen.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Again I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And again, the elders, priests and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them, and these shall be their teachings, as they shall be directed by the Spirit.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And all this ye shall observe to do as I have commanded concerning your teaching, until the fulness of my scriptures is given.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And as ye shall lift up your voices by the Comforter, ye shall speak and prophesy as seemeth me good;</p>
    <p id="section-42_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For, behold, the Comforter knoweth all things, and beareth record of the Father and of the Son.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to come.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he that killeth shall die.</p>

    <p id="section-42_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Thou shalt not commit adultery; and he that committeth adultery, and repenteth not, shall be cast out.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>But he that has committed adultery and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive;</p>
    <p id="section-42_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>But if he doeth it again, he shall not be forgiven, but shall be cast out.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbor, nor do him any harm.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Thou knowest my laws concerning these things are given in my scriptures; he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a deed which cannot be broken.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it unto me; and they shall be laid before the bishop of my church and his counselors, two of the elders, or high priests, such as he shall appoint or has appointed and set apart for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And it shall come to pass, that after they are laid before the bishop of my church, and after that he has received these testimonies concerning the consecration of the properties of my church, that they cannot be taken from the church, agreeable to my commandments, every man shall be made accountable unto me, a steward over his own property, or that which he has received by consecration, as much as is sufficient for himself and family.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And again, if there shall be properties in the hands of the church, or any individuals of it, more than is necessary for their support after this first consecration, which is a residue to be consecrated unto the bishop, it shall be kept to administer to those who have not, from time to time, that every man who has need may be amply supplied and receive according to his wants.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Therefore, the residue shall be kept in my storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy, as shall be appointed by the high council of the church, and the bishop and his council;</p>
    <p id="section-42_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And for the purpose of purchasing lands for the public benefit of the church, and building houses of worship, and building up of the New Jerusalem which is hereafter to be revealed—</p>
    <p id="section-42_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>That my covenant people may be gathered in one in that day when I shall come to my temple. And this I do for the salvation of my people.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And it shall come to pass, that he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out of the church, and shall not receive again that which he has consecrated unto the poor and the needy of my church, or in other words, unto me—</p>
    <p id="section-42_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>For inasmuch as ye do it unto the least of these, ye do it unto me.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>For it shall come to pass, that which I spake by the mouths of my prophets shall be fulfilled; for I will consecrate of the riches of those who embrace my gospel among the Gentiles unto the poor of my people who are of the house of Israel.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And again, thou shalt not be proud in thy heart; let all thy garments be plain, and their beauty the beauty of the work of thine own hands;</p>
    <p id="section-42_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And let all things be done in cleanliness before me.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And whosoever among you are sick, and have not faith to be healed, but believe, shall be nourished with all tenderness, with herbs and mild food, and that not by the hand of an enemy.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die, and more especially for those that have not hope of a glorious resurrection.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them;</p>
    <p id="section-42_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And they that die not in me, wo unto them, for their death is bitter.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And again, it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>He who hath faith to see shall see.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>He who hath faith to hear shall hear.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>The lame who hath faith to leap shall leap.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And they who have not faith to do these things, but believe in me, have power to become my sons; and inasmuch as they break not my laws thou shalt bear their infirmities.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>Thou shalt stand in the place of thy stewardship.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>Thou shalt not take thy brother’s garment; thou shalt pay for that which thou shalt receive of thy brother.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And if thou obtainest more than that which would be for thy support, thou shalt give it into my storehouse, that all things may be done according to that which I have said.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>Thou shalt ask, and my scriptures shall be given as I have appointed, and they shall be preserved in safety;</p>
    <p id="section-42_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>And it is expedient that thou shouldst hold thy peace concerning them, and not teach them until ye have received them in full.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>And I give unto you a commandment that then ye shall teach them unto all men; for they shall be taught unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>Thou shalt take the things which thou hast received, which have been given unto thee in my scriptures for a law, to be my law to govern my church;</p>
    <p id="section-42_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>And he that doeth according to these things shall be saved, and he that doeth them not shall be damned if he so continue.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things—that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>Thou shalt ask, and it shall be revealed unto you in mine own due time where the New Jerusalem shall be built.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>And behold, it shall come to pass that my servants shall be sent forth to the east and to the west, to the north and to the south.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>And even now, let him that goeth to the east teach them that shall be converted to flee to the west, and this in consequence of that which is coming on the earth, and of secret combinations.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>Behold, thou shalt observe all these things, and great shall be thy reward; for unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom, but unto the world it is not given to know them.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>Ye shall observe the laws which ye have received and be faithful.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>And ye shall hereafter receive church covenants, such as shall be sufficient to establish you, both here and in the New Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>Therefore, he that lacketh wisdom, let him ask of me, and I will give him liberally and upbraid him not.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v69" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69 </span>Lift up your hearts and rejoice, for unto you the kingdom, or in other words, the keys of the church have been given. Even so. Amen.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v70" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70 </span>The priests and teachers shall have their stewardships, even as the members.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v71" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71 </span>And the elders or high priests who are appointed to assist the bishop as counselors in all things, are to have their families supported out of the property which is consecrated to the bishop, for the good of the poor, and for other purposes, as before mentioned;</p>
    <p id="section-42_v72" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72 </span>Or they are to receive a just remuneration for all their services, either a stewardship or otherwise, as may be thought best or decided by the counselors and bishop.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v73" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">73 </span>And the bishop, also, shall receive his support, or a just remuneration for all his services in the church.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v74" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74 </span>Behold, verily I say unto you, that whatever persons among you, having put away their companions for the cause of fornication, or in other words, if they shall testify before you in all lowliness of heart that this is the case, ye shall not cast them out from among you;</p>
    <p id="section-42_v75" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">75 </span>But if ye shall find that any persons have left their companions for the sake of adultery, and they themselves are the offenders, and their companions are living, they shall be cast out from among you.</p>

    <p id="section-42_v80" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">80 </span>And if any man or woman shall commit adultery, he or she shall be tried before two elders of the church, or more, and every word shall be established against him or her by two witnesses of the church, and not of the enemy; but if there are more than two witnesses it is better.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v81" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">81 </span>But he or she shall be condemned by the mouth of two witnesses; and the elders shall lay the case before the church, and the church shall lift up their hands against him or her, that they may be dealt with according to the law of God.</p>
    <p id="section-42_v82" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">82 </span>And if it can be, it is necessary that the bishop be present also.</p>

    <p id="section-43_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations from my hand.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And this ye shall know assuredly—that there is none other appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide in me.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be through him; for if it be taken from him he shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come before you as revelations or commandments;</p>
    <p id="section-43_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may know they are not of me.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations which you have received and shall receive through him whom I have appointed.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me—</p>
    <p id="section-43_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>That inasmuch as ye do this, glory shall be added to the kingdom which ye have received. Inasmuch as ye do it not, it shall be taken, even that which ye have received.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Purge ye out the iniquity which is among you; sanctify yourselves before me;</p>
    <p id="section-43_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And if ye desire the glories of the kingdom, appoint ye my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and uphold him before me by the prayer of faith.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And again, I say unto you, that if ye desire the mysteries of the kingdom, provide for him food and raiment, and whatsoever thing he needeth to accomplish the work wherewith I have commanded him;</p>
    <p id="section-43_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And if ye do it not he shall remain unto them that have received him, that I may reserve unto myself a pure people before me.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Again I say, hearken ye elders of my church, whom I have appointed: Ye are not sent forth to be taught, but to teach the children of men the things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit;</p>
    <p id="section-43_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye shall be endowed with power, that ye may give even as I have spoken.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Hearken ye, for, behold, the great day of the Lord is nigh at hand.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven; the heavens shall shake and the earth shall tremble, and the trump of God shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping nations: Ye saints arise and live; ye sinners stay and sleep until I shall call again.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Wherefore gird up your loins lest ye be found among the wicked.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon the nations to repent, both old and young, both bond and free, saying: Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord;</p>
    <p id="section-43_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to repent, and ye hate me, what will ye say when the day cometh when the thunders shall utter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking to the ears of all that live, saying—Repent, and prepare for the great day of the Lord?</p>
    <p id="section-43_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Yea, and again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from the east unto the west, and shall utter forth their voices unto all that live, and make the ears of all tingle that hear, saying these words—Repent ye, for the great day of the Lord is come?</p>
    <p id="section-43_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying: Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who made you.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>O, ye nations of the earth, how often would I have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not!</p>
    <p id="section-43_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor and the riches of eternal life, and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, but ye would not!</p>
    <p id="section-43_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Behold, the day has come, when the cup of the wrath of mine indignation is full.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are the words of the Lord your God.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Wherefore, labor ye, labor ye in my vineyard for the last time—for the last time call upon the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>For in mine own due time will I come upon the earth in judgment, and my people shall be redeemed and shall reign with me on earth.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>For the great Millennium, of which I have spoken by the mouth of my servants, shall come.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>For Satan shall be bound, and when he is loosed again he shall only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end of the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And he that liveth in righteousness shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and the earth shall pass away so as by fire.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And the wicked shall go away into unquenchable fire, and their end no man knoweth on earth, nor ever shall know, until they come before me in judgment.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Hearken ye to these words. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. Treasure these things up in your hearts, and let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.</p>
    <p id="section-43_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Be sober. Keep all my commandments. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-44_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And it shall come to pass, that inasmuch as they are faithful, and exercise faith in me, I will pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together.</p>

    <h2 id="section-45" class="chapter-title">Section 45</h2>
    <p id="section-45_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all things were made which live, and move, and have a being.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And again I say, hearken unto my voice, lest death shall overtake you; in an hour when ye think not the summer shall be past, and the harvest ended, and your souls not saved.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him—</p>
    <p id="section-45_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Hearken, O ye people of my church, and ye elders listen together, and hear my voice while it is called today, and harden not your hearts;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>For verily I say unto you that I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the light and the life of the world—a light that shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>I came unto mine own, and mine own received me not; but unto as many as received me gave I power to do many miracles, and to become the sons of God; and even unto them that believed on my name gave I power to obtain eternal life.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way before me.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Wherefore, come ye unto it, and with him that cometh I will reason as with men in days of old, and I will show unto you my strong reasoning.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Wherefore, hearken ye together and let me show unto you even my wisdom—the wisdom of him whom ye say is the God of Enoch, and his brethren,</p>
    <p id="section-45_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Who were separated from the earth, and were received unto myself—a city reserved until a day of righteousness shall come—a day which was sought for by all holy men, and they found it not because of wickedness and abominations;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And confessed they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But obtained a promise that they should find it and see it in their flesh.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Wherefore, hearken and I will reason with you, and I will speak unto you and prophesy, as unto men in days of old.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And I will show it plainly as I showed it unto my disciples as I stood before them in the flesh, and spake unto them, saying: As ye have asked of me concerning the signs of my coming, in the day when I shall come in my glory in the clouds of heaven, to fulfil the promises that I have made unto your fathers,</p>
    <p id="section-45_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For as ye have looked upon the long absence of your spirits from your bodies to be a bondage, I will show unto you how the day of redemption shall come, and also the restoration of the scattered Israel.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And now ye behold this temple which is in Jerusalem, which ye call the house of God, and your enemies say that this house shall never fall.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>But, verily I say unto you, that desolation shall come upon this generation as a thief in the night, and this people shall be destroyed and scattered among all nations.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And this temple which ye now see shall be thrown down that there shall not be left one stone upon another.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And it shall come to pass, that this generation of Jews shall not pass away until every desolation which I have told you concerning them shall come to pass.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Ye say that ye know that the end of the world cometh; ye say also that ye know that the heavens and the earth shall pass away;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And in this ye say truly, for so it is; but these things which I have told you shall not pass away until all shall be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And this I have told you concerning Jerusalem; and when that day shall come, shall a remnant be scattered among all nations;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>But they shall be gathered again; but they shall remain until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men’s hearts shall fail them, and they shall say that Christ delayeth his coming until the end of the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>But they receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And in that generation shall the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And there shall be men standing in that generation, that shall not pass until they shall see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover the land.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved; but among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and curse God and die.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And there shall be earthquakes also in divers places, and many desolations; yet men will harden their hearts against me, and they will take up the sword, one against another, and they will kill one another.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And now, when I the Lord had spoken these words unto my disciples, they were troubled.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And I said unto them: Be not troubled, for, when all these things shall come to pass, ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you shall be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And when the light shall begin to break forth, it shall be with them like unto a parable which I will show you—</p>
    <p id="section-45_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>Ye look and behold the fig trees, and ye see them with your eyes, and ye say when they begin to shoot forth, and their leaves are yet tender, that summer is now nigh at hand;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Even so it shall be in that day when they shall see all these things, then shall they know that the hour is nigh.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And it shall come to pass that he that feareth me shall be looking forth for the great day of the Lord to come, even for the signs of the coming of the Son of Man.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And they shall see signs and wonders, for they shall be shown forth in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And they shall behold blood, and fire, and vapors of smoke.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And before the day of the Lord shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood, and the stars fall from heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And the remnant shall be gathered unto this place;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And then they shall look for me, and, behold, I will come; and they shall see me in the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great glory; with all the holy angels; and he that watches not for me shall be cut off.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>But before the arm of the Lord shall fall, an angel shall sound his trump, and the saints that have slept shall come forth to meet me in the cloud.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Wherefore, if ye have slept in peace blessed are you; for as you now behold me and know that I am, even so shall ye come unto me and your souls shall live, and your redemption shall be perfected; and the saints shall come forth from the four quarters of the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Then shall the arm of the Lord fall upon the nations.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And then shall the Lord set his foot upon this mount, and it shall cleave in twain, and the earth shall tremble, and reel to and fro, and the heavens also shall shake.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>And the Lord shall utter his voice, and all the ends of the earth shall hear it; and the nations of the earth shall mourn, and they that have laughed shall see their folly.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And calamity shall cover the mocker, and the scorner shall be consumed; and they that have watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and cast into the fire.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And then shall the Jews look upon me and say: What are these wounds in thine hands and in thy feet?</p>
    <p id="section-45_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>Then shall they know that I am the Lord; for I will say unto them: These wounds are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was crucified. I am the Son of God.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>And then shall they weep because of their iniquities; then shall they lament because they persecuted their king.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And then shall the heathen nations be redeemed, and they that knew no law shall have part in the first resurrection; and it shall be tolerable for them.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And Satan shall be bound, that he shall have no place in the hearts of the children of men.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived—verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>And the earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall multiply and wax strong, and their children shall grow up without sin unto salvation.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>And now, behold, I say unto you, it shall not be given unto you to know any further concerning this chapter, until the New Testament be translated, and in it all these things shall be made known;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>Wherefore I give unto you that ye may now translate it, that ye may be prepared for the things to come.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>For verily I say unto you, that great things await you;</p>
    <p id="section-45_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>Ye hear of wars in foreign lands; but, behold, I say unto you, they are nigh, even at your doors, and not many years hence ye shall hear of wars in your own lands.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>Wherefore I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out from the eastern lands, assemble ye yourselves together ye elders of my church; go ye forth into the western countries, call upon the inhabitants to repent, and inasmuch as they do repent, build up churches unto me.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>And with one heart and with one mind, gather up your riches that ye may purchase an inheritance which shall hereafter be appointed unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-45_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>And it shall be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety for the saints of the Most High God;</p>

    <h2 id="section-46" class="chapter-title">Section 46</h2>
    <p id="section-46_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken, O ye people of my church; for verily I say unto you that these things were spoken unto you for your profit and learning.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>But notwithstanding those things which are written, it always has been given to the elders of my church from the beginning, and ever shall be, to conduct all meetings as they are directed and guided by the Holy Spirit.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Nevertheless ye are commanded never to cast any one out from your public meetings, which are held before the world.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Ye are also commanded not to cast any one who belongeth to the church out of your sacrament meetings; nevertheless, if any have trespassed, let him not partake until he makes reconciliation.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And again I say unto you, ye shall not cast any out of your sacrament meetings who are earnestly seeking the kingdom—I speak this concerning those who are not of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And again I say unto you, concerning your confirmation meetings, that if there be any that are not of the church, that are earnestly seeking after the kingdom, ye shall not cast them out.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>But ye are commanded in all things to ask of God, who giveth liberally; and that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do in all holiness of heart, walking uprightly before me, considering the end of your salvation, doing all things with prayer and thanksgiving, that ye may not be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines of devils, or the commandments of men; for some are of men, and others of devils.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be deceived seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given;</p>
    <p id="section-46_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not for a sign that they may consume it upon their lusts.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember, and always retain in your minds what those gifts are, that are given unto the church.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And again, to some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know the differences of administration, as it will be pleasing unto the same Lord, according as the Lord will, suiting his mercies according to the conditions of the children of men.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And again, it is given by the Holy Ghost to some to know the diversities of operations, whether they be of God, that the manifestations of the Spirit may be given to every man to profit withal.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, to some is given, by the Spirit of God, the word of wisdom.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>To another is given the word of knowledge, that all may be taught to be wise and to have knowledge.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And again, to some it is given to have faith to be healed;</p>
    <p id="section-46_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And to others it is given to have faith to heal.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And again, to some is given the working of miracles;</p>
    <p id="section-46_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And to others it is given to prophesy;</p>
    <p id="section-46_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And to others the discerning of spirits.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And again, it is given to some to speak with tongues;</p>
    <p id="section-46_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And to another is given the interpretation of tongues.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And all these gifts come from God, for the benefit of the children of God.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And unto the bishop of the church, and unto such as God shall appoint and ordain to watch over the church and to be elders unto the church, are to have it given unto them to discern all those gifts lest there shall be any among you professing and yet be not of God.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And it shall come to pass that he that asketh in Spirit shall receive in Spirit;</p>
    <p id="section-46_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>That unto some it may be given to have all those gifts, that there may be a head, in order that every member may be profited thereby.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And again, I say unto you, all things must be done in the name of Christ, whatsoever you do in the Spirit;</p>
    <p id="section-46_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with.</p>
    <p id="section-46_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And ye must practice virtue and holiness before me continually. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-49" class="chapter-title">Section 49</h2>
    <p id="section-49_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken unto my word, my servants Sidney, and Parley, and Leman; for behold, verily I say unto you, that I give unto you a commandment that you shall go and preach my gospel which ye have received, even as ye have received it, unto the Shakers.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Behold, I say unto you, that they desire to know the truth in part, but not all, for they are not right before me and must needs repent.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Wherefore, I send you, my servants Sidney and Parley, to preach the gospel unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And my servant Leman shall be ordained unto this work, that he may reason with them, not according to that which he has received of them, but according to that which shall be taught him by you my servants; and by so doing I will bless him, otherwise he shall not prosper.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Thus saith the Lord; for I am God, and have sent mine Only Begotten Son into the world for the redemption of the world, and have decreed that he that receiveth him shall be saved, and he that receiveth him not shall be damned—</p>
    <p id="section-49_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And they have done unto the Son of Man even as they listed; and he has taken his power on the right hand of his glory, and now reigneth in the heavens, and will reign till he descends on the earth to put all enemies under his feet, which time is nigh at hand—</p>
    <p id="section-49_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>I, the Lord God, have spoken it; but the hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Wherefore, I will that all men shall repent, for all are under sin, except those which I have reserved unto myself, holy men that ye know not of.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Wherefore, I say unto you that I have sent unto you mine everlasting covenant, even that which was from the beginning.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And that which I have promised I have so fulfilled, and the nations of the earth shall bow to it; and, if not of themselves, they shall come down, for that which is now exalted of itself shall be laid low of power.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Wherefore, I give unto you a commandment that ye go among this people, and say unto them, like unto mine apostle of old, whose name was Peter:</p>

    <p id="section-49_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And whoso doeth this shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of the hands of the elders of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation;</p>
    <p id="section-49_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And whoso forbiddeth to abstain from meats, that man should not eat the same, is not ordained of God;</p>
    <p id="section-49_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>For, behold, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which cometh of the earth, is ordained for the use of man for food and for raiment, and that he might have in abundance.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But it is not given that one man should possess that which is above another, wherefore the world lieth in sin.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And wo be unto man that sheddeth blood or that wasteth flesh and hath no need.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, that the Son of Man cometh not in the form of a woman, neither of a man traveling on the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Wherefore, be not deceived, but continue in steadfastness, looking forth for the heavens to be shaken, and the earth to tremble and to reel to and fro as a drunken man, and for the valleys to be exalted, and for the mountains to be made low, and for the rough places to become smooth—and all this when the angel shall sound his trumpet.</p>
    <p id="section-49_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>But before the great day of the Lord shall come, Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness, and the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose.</p>

    <h2 id="section-50" class="chapter-title">Section 50</h2>
    <p id="section-50_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to the voice of the living God; and attend to the words of wisdom which shall be given unto you, according as ye have asked and are agreed as touching the church, and the spirits which have gone abroad in the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many spirits which are false spirits, which have gone forth in the earth, deceiving the world.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And also Satan hath sought to deceive you, that he might overthrow you.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Behold, I, the Lord, have looked upon you, and have seen abominations in the church that profess my name.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>But blessed are they who are faithful and endure, whether in life or in death, for they shall inherit eternal life.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>But wo unto them that are deceivers and hypocrites, for, thus saith the Lord, I will bring them to judgment.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Behold, verily I say unto you, there are hypocrites among you, who have deceived some, which has given the adversary power; but behold such shall be reclaimed;</p>
    <p id="section-50_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But the hypocrites shall be detected and shall be cut off, either in life or in death, even as I will; and wo unto them who are cut off from my church, for the same are overcome of the world.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Wherefore, let every man beware lest he do that which is not in truth and righteousness before me.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit, unto the elders of his church, and let us reason together, that ye may understand;</p>
    <p id="section-50_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Let us reason even as a man reasoneth one with another face to face.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Now, when a man reasoneth he is understood of man, because he reasoneth as a man; even so will I, the Lord, reason with you that you may understand.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question—unto what were ye ordained?</p>
    <p id="section-50_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent forth to teach the truth.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And then received ye spirits which ye could not understand, and received them to be of God; and in this are ye justified?</p>
    <p id="section-50_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Behold ye shall answer this question yourselves; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto you; he that is weak among you hereafter shall be made strong.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Verily I say unto you, he that is ordained of me and sent forth to preach the word of truth by the Comforter, in the Spirit of truth, doth he preach it by the Spirit of truth or some other way?</p>
    <p id="section-50_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And if it be by some other way it is not of God.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And again, he that receiveth the word of truth, doth he receive it by the Spirit of truth or some other way?</p>
    <p id="section-50_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>If it be some other way it is not of God.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he that receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the Spirit of truth?</p>
    <p id="section-50_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together.</p>
    <p id="section-50_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</p>

    <p id="section-51_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, and I will speak unto my servant Edward Partridge, and give unto him directions; for it must needs be that he receive directions how to organize this people.</p>
    <p id="section-51_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For it must needs be that they be organized according to my laws; if otherwise, they will be cut off.</p>
    <p id="section-51_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Wherefore, let my servant Edward Partridge, and those whom he has chosen, in whom I am well pleased, appoint unto this people their portions, every man equal according to his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and needs.</p>
    <p id="section-51_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And let my servant Edward Partridge, when he shall appoint a man his portion, give unto him a writing that shall secure unto him his portion, that he shall hold it, even this right and this inheritance in the church, until he transgresses and is not accounted worthy by the voice of the church, according to the laws and covenants of the church, to belong to the church.</p>
    <p id="section-51_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And if he shall transgress and is not accounted worthy to belong to the church, he shall not have power to claim that portion which he has consecrated unto the bishop for the poor and needy of my church; therefore, he shall not retain the gift, but shall only have claim on that portion that is deeded unto him.</p>
    <p id="section-51_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And thus all things shall be made sure, according to the laws of the land.</p>
    <p id="section-51_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And let that which belongs to this people be appointed unto this people.</p>

    <p id="section-51_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And let every man deal honestly, and be alike among this people, and receive alike, that ye may be one, even as I have commanded you.</p>
    <p id="section-51_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And let that which belongeth to this people not be taken and given unto that of another church.</p>
    <p id="section-51_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Wherefore, if another church would receive money of this church, let them pay unto this church again according as they shall agree;</p>
    <p id="section-51_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And this shall be done through the bishop or the agent, which shall be appointed by the voice of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-51_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And again, let the bishop appoint a storehouse unto this church; and let all things both in money and in meat, which are more than is needful for the wants of this people, be kept in the hands of the bishop.</p>

    <p id="section-52_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Saying: I, the Lord, will make known unto you what I will that ye shall do from this time until the next conference, which shall be held in Missouri, upon the land which I will consecrate unto my people, which are a remnant of Jacob, and those who are heirs according to the covenant.</p>
    <p id="section-52_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Wherefore, verily I say unto you, let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon take their journey as soon as preparations can be made to leave their homes, and journey to the land of Missouri.</p>

    <p id="section-52_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And let them journey from thence preaching the word by the way, saying none other things than that which the prophets and apostles have written, and that which is taught them by the Comforter through the prayer of faith.</p>
    <p id="section-52_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands by the water’s side.</p>
    <p id="section-52_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>For thus saith the Lord, I will cut my work short in righteousness, for the days come that I will send forth judgment unto victory.</p>
    <p id="section-52_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And let my servant Lyman Wight beware, for Satan desireth to sift him as chaff.</p>

    <p id="section-52_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations—</p>

    <p id="section-52_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>He that is faithful, the same shall be kept and blessed with much fruit.</p>
    <p id="section-52_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And again, I say unto you, let my servants Joseph Wakefield and Solomon Humphrey take their journey into the eastern lands;</p>
    <p id="section-52_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Let them labor with their families, declaring none other things than the prophets and apostles, that which they have seen and heard and most assuredly believe, that the prophecies may be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-52_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>In consequence of transgression, let that which was bestowed upon Heman Basset be taken from him, and placed upon the head of Simonds Ryder.</p>
    <p id="section-52_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, let Jared Carter be ordained a priest, and also George James be ordained a priest.</p>
    <p id="section-52_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Let the residue of the elders watch over the churches, and declare the word in the regions round about them; and let them labor with their own hands that there be no idolatry nor wickedness practiced.</p>
    <p id="section-52_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple.</p>

    <h2 id="section-56" class="chapter-title">Section 56</h2>
    <p id="section-56_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken, O ye people who profess my name, saith the Lord your God; for behold, mine anger is kindled against the rebellious, and they shall know mine arm and mine indignation, in the day of visitation and of wrath upon the nations.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And he that will not take up his cross and follow me, and keep my commandments, the same shall not be saved.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Behold, I, the Lord, command; and he that will not obey shall be cut off in mine own due time, after I have commanded and the commandment is broken.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Wherefore I, the Lord, command and revoke, as it seemeth me good; and all this to be answered upon the heads of the rebellious, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Wherefore, I revoke the commandment which was given unto my servants Thomas B. Marsh and Ezra Thayre, and give a new commandment unto my servant Thomas, that he shall take up his journey speedily to the land of Missouri, and my servant Selah J. Griffin shall also go with him.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>For behold, I revoke the commandment which was given unto my servants Selah J. Griffin and Newel Knight, in consequence of the stiffneckedness of my people which are in Thompson, and their rebellions.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Wherefore, let my servant Newel Knight remain with them; and as many as will go may go, that are contrite before me, and be led by him to the land which I have appointed.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, that my servant Ezra Thayre must repent of his pride, and of his selfishness, and obey the former commandment which I have given him concerning the place upon which he lives.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And if he will do this, as there shall be no divisions made upon the land, he shall be appointed still to go to the land of Missouri;</p>
    <p id="section-56_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Otherwise he shall receive the money which he has paid, and shall leave the place, and shall be cut off out of my church, saith the Lord God of hosts;</p>
    <p id="section-56_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And though the heaven and the earth pass away, these words shall not pass away, but shall be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And if my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., must needs pay the money, behold, I, the Lord, will pay it unto him again in the land of Missouri, that those of whom he shall receive may be rewarded again according to that which they do;</p>
    <p id="section-56_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>For according to that which they do they shall receive, even in lands for their inheritance.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my people—you have many things to do and to repent of; for behold, your sins have come up unto me, and are not pardoned, because you seek to counsel in your own ways.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And your hearts are not satisfied. And ye obey not the truth, but have pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved!</p>
    <p id="section-56_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Wo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits are not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed from laying hold upon other men’s goods, whose eyes are full of greediness, and who will not labor with your own hands!</p>
    <p id="section-56_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>But blessed are the poor who are pure in heart, whose hearts are broken, and whose spirits are contrite, for they shall see the kingdom of God coming in power and great glory unto their deliverance; for the fatness of the earth shall be theirs.</p>
    <p id="section-56_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>For behold, the Lord shall come, and his recompense shall be with him, and he shall reward every man, and the poor shall rejoice;</p>
    <p id="section-56_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And their generations shall inherit the earth from generation to generation, forever and ever. And now I make an end of speaking unto you. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-57" class="chapter-title">Section 57</h2>
    <p id="section-57_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, who have assembled yourselves together, according to my commandments, in this land, which is the land of Missouri, which is the land which I have appointed and consecrated for the gathering of the saints.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Wherefore, this is the land of promise, and the place for the city of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And thus saith the Lord your God, if you will receive wisdom here is wisdom. Behold, the place which is now called Independence is the center place; and a spot for the temple is lying westward, upon a lot which is not far from the courthouse.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Wherefore, it is wisdom that the land should be purchased by the saints, and also every tract lying westward, even unto the line running directly between Jew and Gentile;</p>
    <p id="section-57_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And also every tract bordering by the prairies, inasmuch as my disciples are enabled to buy lands. Behold, this is wisdom, that they may obtain it for an everlasting inheritance.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And let my servant Sidney Gilbert stand in the office to which I have appointed him, to receive moneys, to be an agent unto the church, to buy land in all the regions round about, inasmuch as can be done in righteousness, and as wisdom shall direct.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And let my servant Edward Partridge stand in the office to which I have appointed him, and divide unto the saints their inheritance, even as I have commanded; and also those whom he has appointed to assist him.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Sidney Gilbert plant himself in this place, and establish a store, that he may sell goods without fraud, that he may obtain money to buy lands for the good of the saints, and that he may obtain whatsoever things the disciples may need to plant them in their inheritance.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And also let my servant Sidney Gilbert obtain a license—behold here is wisdom, and whoso readeth let him understand—that he may send goods also unto the people, even by whom he will as clerks employed in his service;</p>
    <p id="section-57_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And thus provide for my saints, that my gospel may be preached unto those who sit in darkness and in the region and shadow of death.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William W. Phelps be planted in this place, and be established as a printer unto the church.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And lo, if the world receive his writings—behold here is wisdom—let him obtain whatsoever he can obtain in righteousness, for the good of the saints.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And let my servant Oliver Cowdery assist him, even as I have commanded, in whatsoever place I shall appoint unto him, to copy, and to correct, and select, that all things may be right before me, as it shall be proved by the Spirit through him.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And thus let those of whom I have spoken be planted in the land of Zion, as speedily as can be, with their families, to do those things even as I have spoken.</p>
    <p id="section-57_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And now concerning the gathering—Let the bishop and the agent make preparations for those families which have been commanded to come to this land, as soon as possible, and plant them in their inheritance.</p>

    <h2 id="section-58" class="chapter-title">Section 58</h2>
    <p id="section-58_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear to my word, and learn of me what I will concerning you, and also concerning this land unto which I have sent you.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Remember this, which I tell you before, that you may lay it to heart, and receive that which is to follow.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Behold, verily I say unto you, for this cause I have sent you—that you might be obedient, and that your hearts might be prepared to bear testimony of the things which are to come;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And also that you might be honored in laying the foundation, and in bearing record of the land upon which the Zion of God shall stand;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And also that a feast of fat things might be prepared for the poor; yea, a feast of fat things, of wine on the lees well refined, that the earth may know that the mouths of the prophets shall not fail;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Yea, a supper of the house of the Lord, well prepared, unto which all nations shall be invited.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>First, the rich and the learned, the wise and the noble;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And after that cometh the day of my power; then shall the poor, the lame, and the blind, and the deaf, come in unto the marriage of the Lamb, and partake of the supper of the Lord, prepared for the great day to come.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Behold, I, the Lord, have spoken it.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And that the testimony might go forth from Zion, yea, from the mouth of the city of the heritage of God—</p>
    <p id="section-58_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Yea, for this cause I have sent you hither, and have selected my servant Edward Partridge, and have appointed unto him his mission in this land.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>But if he repent not of his sins, which are unbelief and blindness of heart, let him take heed lest he fall.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Behold his mission is given unto him, and it shall not be given again.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And whoso standeth in this mission is appointed to be a judge in Israel, like as it was in ancient days, to divide the lands of the heritage of God unto his children;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And to judge his people by the testimony of the just, and by the assistance of his counselors, according to the laws of the kingdom which are given by the prophets of God.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>For verily I say unto you, my law shall be kept on this land.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Let no man think he is ruler; but let God rule him that judgeth, according to the counsel of his own will, or, in other words, him that counseleth or sitteth upon the judgment seat.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right it is to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Behold, the laws which ye have received from my hand are the laws of the church, and in this light ye shall hold them forth. Behold, here is wisdom.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And now, as I spake concerning my servant Edward Partridge, this land is the land of his residence, and those whom he has appointed for his counselors; and also the land of the residence of him whom I have appointed to keep my storehouse;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Wherefore, let them bring their families to this land, as they shall counsel between themselves and me.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless that obeys not my commandments?</p>
    <p id="section-58_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled?</p>
    <p id="section-58_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Then they say in their hearts: This is not the work of the Lord, for his promises are not fulfilled. But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh beneath, and not from above.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And now I give unto you further directions concerning this land.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>It is wisdom in me that my servant Martin Harris should be an example unto the church, in laying his moneys before the bishop of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And also, this is a law unto every man that cometh unto this land to receive an inheritance; and he shall do with his moneys according as the law directs.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And it is wisdom also that there should be lands purchased in Independence, for the place of the storehouse, and also for the house of the printing.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And other directions concerning my servant Martin Harris shall be given him of the Spirit, that he may receive his inheritance as seemeth him good;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And let him repent of his sins, for he seeketh the praise of the world.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And also let my servant William W. Phelps stand in the office to which I have appointed him, and receive his inheritance in the land;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And also he hath need to repent, for I, the Lord, am not well pleased with him, for he seeketh to excel, and he is not sufficiently meek before me.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And now, verily, I say concerning the residue of the elders of my church, the time has not yet come, for many years, for them to receive their inheritance in this land, except they desire it through the prayer of faith, only as it shall be appointed unto them of the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>For, behold, they shall push the people together from the ends of the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Wherefore, assemble yourselves together; and they who are not appointed to stay in this land, let them preach the gospel in the regions round about; and after that let them return to their homes.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Let them preach by the way, and bear testimony of the truth in all places, and call upon the rich, the high and the low, and the poor to repent.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And let them build up churches, inasmuch as the inhabitants of the earth will repent.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>And let there be an agent appointed by the voice of the church, unto the church in Ohio, to receive moneys to purchase lands in Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And I give unto my servant Sidney Rigdon a commandment, that he shall write a description of the land of Zion, and a statement of the will of God, as it shall be made known by the Spirit unto him;</p>
    <p id="section-58_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And an epistle and subscription, to be presented unto all the churches to obtain moneys, to be put into the hands of the bishop, of himself or the agent, as seemeth him good or as he shall direct, to purchase lands for an inheritance for the children of God.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>For, behold, verily I say unto you, the Lord willeth that the disciples and the children of men should open their hearts, even to purchase this whole region of country, as soon as time will permit.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>Behold, here is wisdom. Let them do this lest they receive none inheritance, save it be by the shedding of blood.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And again, inasmuch as there is land obtained, let there be workmen sent forth of all kinds unto this land, to labor for the saints of God.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>Let all these things be done in order; and let the privileges of the lands be made known from time to time, by the bishop or the agent of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And let the work of the gathering be not in haste, nor by flight; but let it be done as it shall be counseled by the elders of the church at the conferences, according to the knowledge which they receive from time to time.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>And let my servant Sidney Rigdon consecrate and dedicate this land, and the spot for the temple, unto the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>And let a conference meeting be called; and after that let my servants Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun., return, and also Oliver Cowdery with them, to accomplish the residue of the work which I have appointed unto them in their own land, and the residue as shall be ruled by the conferences.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>And let no man return from this land except he bear record by the way, of that which he knows and most assuredly believes.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>Let that which has been bestowed upon Ziba Peterson be taken from him; and let him stand as a member in the church, and labor with his own hands, with the brethren, until he is sufficiently chastened for all his sins; for he confesseth them not, and he thinketh to hide them.</p>
    <p id="section-58_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>Let the residue of the elders of this church, who are coming to this land, some of whom are exceedingly blessed even above measure, also hold a conference upon this land.</p>

    <h2 id="section-59" class="chapter-title">Section 59</h2>
    <p id="section-59_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they who have come up unto this land with an eye single to my glory, according to my commandments.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For those that live shall inherit the earth, and those that die shall rest from all their labors, and their works shall follow them; and they shall receive a crown in the mansions of my Father, which I have prepared for them.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Yea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth, and it shall bring forth in its strength.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with commandments not a few, and with revelations in their time—they that are faithful and diligent before me.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;</p>
    <p id="section-59_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High;</p>
    <p id="section-59_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times;</p>
    <p id="section-59_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>But remember that on this, the Lord’s day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy may be full.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Verily, this is fasting and prayer, or in other words, rejoicing and prayer.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance—</p>
    <p id="section-59_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth;</p>
    <p id="section-59_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Yea, and the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, whether for food or for raiment, or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for gardens, or for vineyards;</p>
    <p id="section-59_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart;</p>
    <p id="section-59_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Behold, this is according to the law and the prophets; wherefore, trouble me no more concerning this matter.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.</p>
    <p id="section-59_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>I, the Lord, have spoken it, and the Spirit beareth record. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-60_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Behold, thus saith the Lord unto the elders of his church, who are to return speedily to the land from whence they came: Behold, it pleaseth me, that you have come up hither;</p>
    <p id="section-60_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And it shall come to pass, if they are not more faithful unto me, it shall be taken away, even that which they have.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For I, the Lord, rule in the heavens above, and among the armies of the earth; and in the day when I shall make up my jewels, all men shall know what it is that bespeaketh the power of God.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>But, verily, I will speak unto you concerning your journey unto the land from whence you came. Let there be a craft made, or bought, as seemeth you good, it mattereth not unto me, and take your journey speedily for the place which is called St. Louis.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And from thence let my servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, take their journey for Cincinnati;</p>
    <p id="section-60_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And in this place let them lift up their voice and declare my word with loud voices, without wrath or doubting, lifting up holy hands upon them. For I am able to make you holy, and your sins are forgiven you.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And let the residue take their journey from St. Louis, two by two, and preach the word, not in haste, among the congregations of the wicked, until they return to the churches from whence they came.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And all this for the good of the churches; for this intent have I sent them.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And let my servant Edward Partridge impart of the money which I have given him, a portion unto mine elders who are commanded to return;</p>
    <p id="section-60_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And he that is able, let him return it by the way of the agent; and he that is not, of him it is not required.</p>

    <p id="section-60_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Behold, they have been sent to preach my gospel among the congregations of the wicked; wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, thus: Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And after thou hast come up unto the land of Zion, and hast proclaimed my word, thou shalt speedily return, proclaiming my word among the congregations of the wicked, not in haste, neither in wrath nor with strife.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And shake off the dust of thy feet against those who receive thee not, not in their presence, lest thou provoke them, but in secret; and wash thy feet, as a testimony against them in the day of judgment.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Behold, this is sufficient for you, and the will of him who hath sent you.</p>
    <p id="section-60_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And by the mouth of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., it shall be made known concerning Sidney Rigdon and Oliver Cowdery. The residue hereafter. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-61" class="chapter-title">Section 61</h2>
    <p id="section-61_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Behold, and hearken unto the voice of him who has all power, who is from everlasting to everlasting, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Behold, verily thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye elders of my church, who are assembled upon this spot, whose sins are now forgiven you, for I, the Lord, forgive sins, and am merciful unto those who confess their sins with humble hearts;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>But verily I say unto you, that it is not needful for this whole company of mine elders to be moving swiftly upon the waters, whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Nevertheless, I suffered it that ye might bear record; behold, there are many dangers upon the waters, and more especially hereafter;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>For I, the Lord, have decreed in mine anger many destructions upon the waters; yea, and especially upon these waters.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Nevertheless, all flesh is in mine hand, and he that is faithful among you shall not perish by the waters.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Wherefore, it is expedient that my servant Sidney Gilbert and my servant William W. Phelps be in haste upon their errand and mission.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Nevertheless, I would not suffer that ye should part until you were chastened for all your sins, that you might be one, that you might not perish in wickedness;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>But now, verily I say, it behooveth me that ye should part. Wherefore let my servants Sidney Gilbert and William W. Phelps take their former company, and let them take their journey in haste that they may fill their mission, and through faith they shall overcome;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And inasmuch as they are faithful they shall be preserved, and I, the Lord, will be with them.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And let the residue take that which is needful for clothing.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Let my servant Sidney Gilbert take that which is not needful with him, as you shall agree.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And now, behold, for your good I gave unto you a commandment concerning these things; and I, the Lord, will reason with you as with men in days of old.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Behold, I, the Lord, in the beginning blessed the waters; but in the last days, by the mouth of my servant John, I cursed the waters.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Wherefore, the days will come that no flesh shall be safe upon the waters.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the land of Zion upon the waters, but he that is upright in heart.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And, as I, the Lord, in the beginning cursed the land, even so in the last days have I blessed it, in its time, for the use of my saints, that they may partake the fatness thereof.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And now I give unto you a commandment that what I say unto one I say unto all, that you shall forewarn your brethren concerning these waters, that they come not in journeying upon them, lest their faith fail and they are caught in snares;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>I, the Lord, have decreed, and the destroyer rideth upon the face thereof, and I revoke not the decree.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>I, the Lord, was angry with you yesterday, but today mine anger is turned away.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Wherefore, let those concerning whom I have spoken, that should take their journey in haste—again I say unto you, let them take their journey in haste.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And it mattereth not unto me, after a little, if it so be that they fill their mission, whether they go by water or by land; let this be as it is made known unto them according to their judgments hereafter.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And now, concerning my servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, let them come not again upon the waters, save it be upon the canal, while journeying unto their homes; or in other words they shall not come upon the waters to journey, save upon the canal.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Behold, I, the Lord, have appointed a way for the journeying of my saints; and behold, this is the way—that after they leave the canal they shall journey by land, inasmuch as they are commanded to journey and go up unto the land of Zion;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And they shall do like unto the children of Israel, pitching their tents by the way.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And, behold, this commandment you shall give unto all your brethren.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Nevertheless, unto whom is given power to command the waters, unto him it is given by the Spirit to know all his ways;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Wherefore, let him do as the Spirit of the living God commandeth him, whether upon the land or upon the waters, as it remaineth with me to do hereafter.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And unto you is given the course for the saints, or the way for the saints of the camp of the Lord, to journey.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, my servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, shall not open their mouths in the congregations of the wicked until they arrive at Cincinnati;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And in that place they shall lift up their voices unto God against that people, yea, unto him whose anger is kindled against their wickedness, a people who are well-nigh ripened for destruction.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And from thence let them journey for the congregations of their brethren, for their labors even now are wanted more abundantly among them than among the congregations of the wicked.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And now, concerning the residue, let them journey and declare the word among the congregations of the wicked, inasmuch as it is given;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And inasmuch as they do this they shall rid their garments, and they shall be spotless before me.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And let them journey together, or two by two, as seemeth them good, only let my servant Reynolds Cahoon, and my servant Samuel H. Smith, with whom I am well pleased, be not separated until they return to their homes, and this for a wise purpose in me.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, and what I say unto one I say unto all, be of good cheer, little children; for I am in your midst, and I have not forsaken you;</p>
    <p id="section-61_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And inasmuch as you have humbled yourselves before me, the blessings of the kingdom are yours.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Gird up your loins and be watchful and be sober, looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man, for he cometh in an hour you think not.</p>
    <p id="section-61_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Pray always that you enter not into temptation, that you may abide the day of his coming, whether in life or in death. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-63_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Yea, signs come by faith, unto mighty works, for without faith no man pleaseth God; and with whom God is angry he is not well pleased; wherefore, unto such he showeth no signs, only in wrath unto their condemnation.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Wherefore, I, the Lord, am not pleased with those among you who have sought after signs and wonders for faith, and not for the good of men unto my glory.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Nevertheless, I give commandments, and many have turned away from my commandments and have not kept them.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>There were among you adulterers and adulteresses; some of whom have turned away from you, and others remain with you that hereafter shall be revealed.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Let such beware and repent speedily, lest judgment shall come upon them as a snare, and their folly shall be made manifest, and their works shall follow them in the eyes of the people.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And verily I say unto you, as I have said before, he that looketh on a woman to lust after her, or if any shall commit adultery in their hearts, they shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny the faith and shall fear.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Wherefore, I, the Lord, have said that the fearful, and the unbelieving, and all liars, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie, and the whoremonger, and the sorcerer, shall have their part in that lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Verily I say, that they shall not have part in the first resurrection.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And now behold, I, the Lord, say unto you that ye are not justified, because these things are among you.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Nevertheless, he that endureth in faith and doeth my will, the same shall overcome, and shall receive an inheritance upon the earth when the day of transfiguration shall come;</p>
    <p id="section-63_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>When the earth shall be transfigured, even according to the pattern which was shown unto mine apostles upon the mount; of which account the fulness ye have not yet received.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, that as I said that I would make known my will unto you, behold I will make it known unto you, not by the way of commandment, for there are many who observe not to keep my commandments.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But unto him that keepeth my commandments I will give the mysteries of my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And now, behold, this is the will of the Lord your God concerning his saints, that they should assemble themselves together unto the land of Zion, not in haste, lest there should be confusion, which bringeth pestilence.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Behold, the land of Zion—I, the Lord, hold it in mine own hands;</p>
    <p id="section-63_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Nevertheless, I, the Lord, render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Wherefore, I the Lord will that you should purchase the lands, that you may have advantage of the world, that you may have claim on the world, that they may not be stirred up unto anger.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>For Satan putteth it into their hearts to anger against you, and to the shedding of blood.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Wherefore, the land of Zion shall not be obtained but by purchase or by blood, otherwise there is none inheritance for you.</p>

    <p id="section-63_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And if by blood, as you are forbidden to shed blood, lo, your enemies are upon you, and ye shall be scourged from city to city, and from synagogue to synagogue, and but few shall stand to receive an inheritance.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>I, the Lord, am angry with the wicked; I am holding my Spirit from the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>I have sworn in my wrath, and decreed wars upon the face of the earth, and the wicked shall slay the wicked, and fear shall come upon every man;</p>
    <p id="section-63_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And the saints also shall hardly escape; nevertheless, I, the Lord, am with them, and will come down in heaven from the presence of my Father and consume the wicked with unquenchable fire.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And behold, this is not yet, but by and by.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Wherefore, seeing that I, the Lord, have decreed all these things upon the face of the earth, I will that my saints should be assembled upon the land of Zion;</p>
    <p id="section-63_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And that every man should take righteousness in his hands and faithfulness upon his loins, and lift a warning voice unto the inhabitants of the earth; and declare both by word and by flight that desolation shall come upon the wicked.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Wherefore, let my disciples in Kirtland arrange their temporal concerns, who dwell upon this farm.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Let my servant Titus Billings, who has the care thereof, dispose of the land, that he may be prepared in the coming spring to take his journey up unto the land of Zion, with those that dwell upon the face thereof, excepting those whom I shall reserve unto myself, that shall not go until I shall command them.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And let all the moneys which can be spared, it mattereth not unto me whether it be little or much, be sent up unto the land of Zion, unto them whom I have appointed to receive.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Behold, I, the Lord, will give unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., power that he shall be enabled to discern by the Spirit those who shall go up unto the land of Zion, and those of my disciples who shall tarry.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>Let my servant Newel K. Whitney retain his store, or in other words, the store, yet for a little season.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>Nevertheless, let him impart all the money which he can impart, to be sent up unto the land of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>Behold, these things are in his own hands, let him do according to wisdom.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Verily I say, let him be ordained as an agent unto the disciples that shall tarry, and let him be ordained unto this power;</p>
    <p id="section-63_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And now speedily visit the churches, expounding these things unto them, with my servant Oliver Cowdery. Behold, this is my will, obtaining moneys even as I have directed.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>He that is faithful and endureth shall overcome the world.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>He that sendeth up treasures unto the land of Zion shall receive an inheritance in this world, and his works shall follow him, and also a reward in the world to come.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>Yea, and blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth, when the Lord shall come, and old things shall pass away, and all things become new, they shall rise from the dead and shall not die after, and shall receive an inheritance before the Lord, in the holy city.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And he that liveth when the Lord shall come, and hath kept the faith, blessed is he; nevertheless, it is appointed to him to die at the age of man.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>Wherefore, children shall grow up until they become old; old men shall die; but they shall not sleep in the dust, but they shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>Wherefore, for this cause preached the apostles unto the world the resurrection of the dead.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>These things are the things that ye must look for; and, speaking after the manner of the Lord, they are now nigh at hand, and in a time to come, even in the day of the coming of the Son of Man.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And until that hour there will be foolish virgins among the wise; and at that hour cometh an entire separation of the righteous and the wicked; and in that day will I send mine angels to pluck out the wicked and cast them into unquenchable fire.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And now behold, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, am not pleased with my servant Sidney Rigdon; he exalted himself in his heart, and received not counsel, but grieved the Spirit;</p>
    <p id="section-63_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>Wherefore his writing is not acceptable unto the Lord, and he shall make another; and if the Lord receive it not, behold he standeth no longer in the office to which I have appointed him.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, those who desire in their hearts, in meekness, to warn sinners to repentance, let them be ordained unto this power.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>For this is a day of warning, and not a day of many words. For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in the last days.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>Behold, I am from above, and my power lieth beneath. I am over all, and in all, and through all, and search all things, and the day cometh that all things shall be subject unto me.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>Behold, I am Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips—</p>
    <p id="section-63_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>For behold, verily I say, that many there be who are under this condemnation, who use the name of the Lord, and use it in vain, having not authority.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>Wherefore, let the church repent of their sins, and I, the Lord, will own them; otherwise they shall be cut off.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>Remember that that which cometh from above is sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by constraint of the Spirit; and in this there is no condemnation, and ye receive the Spirit through prayer; wherefore, without this there remaineth condemnation.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>Let my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, seek them a home, as they are taught through prayer by the Spirit.</p>
    <p id="section-63_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>These things remain to overcome through patience, that such may receive a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, otherwise, a greater condemnation. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-64" class="chapter-title">Section 64</h2>
    <p id="section-64_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Behold, thus saith the Lord your God unto you, O ye elders of my church, hearken ye and hear, and receive my will concerning you.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For verily I say unto you, I will that ye should overcome the world; wherefore I will have compassion upon you.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>There are those among you who have sinned; but verily I say, for this once, for mine own glory, and for the salvation of souls, I have forgiven you your sins.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>I will be merciful unto you, for I have given unto you the kingdom.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom shall not be taken from my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., through the means I have appointed, while he liveth, inasmuch as he obeyeth mine ordinances.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>There are those who have sought occasion against him without cause;</p>
    <p id="section-64_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Nevertheless, he has sinned; but verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, forgive sins unto those who confess their sins before me and ask forgiveness, who have not sinned unto death.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And ye ought to say in your hearts—let God judge between me and thee, and reward thee according to thy deeds.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And him that repenteth not of his sins, and confesseth them not, ye shall bring before the church, and do with him as the scripture saith unto you, either by commandment or by revelation.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And this ye shall do that God may be glorified—not because ye forgive not, having not compassion, but that ye may be justified in the eyes of the law, that ye may not offend him who is your lawgiver—</p>
    <p id="section-64_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Verily I say, for this cause ye shall do these things.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Behold, I, the Lord, was angry with him who was my servant Ezra Booth, and also my servant Isaac Morley, for they kept not the law, neither the commandment;</p>
    <p id="section-64_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>They sought evil in their hearts, and I, the Lord, withheld my Spirit. They condemned for evil that thing in which there was no evil; nevertheless I have forgiven my servant Isaac Morley.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And also my servant Edward Partridge, behold, he hath sinned, and Satan seeketh to destroy his soul; but when these things are made known unto them, and they repent of the evil, they shall be forgiven.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And now, verily I say that it is expedient in me that my servant Sidney Gilbert, after a few weeks, shall return upon his business, and to his agency in the land of Zion;</p>
    <p id="section-64_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And that which he hath seen and heard may be made known unto my disciples, that they perish not. And for this cause have I spoken these things.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And again, I say unto you, that my servant Isaac Morley may not be tempted above that which he is able to bear, and counsel wrongfully to your hurt, I gave commandment that his farm should be sold.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>I will not that my servant Frederick G. Williams should sell his farm, for I, the Lord, will to retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years, in the which I will not overthrow the wicked, that thereby I may save some.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And after that day, I, the Lord, will not hold any guilty that shall go with an open heart up to the land of Zion; for I, the Lord, require the hearts of the children of men.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>For after today cometh the burning—this is speaking after the manner of the Lord—for verily I say, tomorrow all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of Hosts; and I will not spare any that remain in Babylon.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Wherefore, if ye believe me, ye will labor while it is called today.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And it is not meet that my servants, Newel K. Whitney and Sidney Gilbert, should sell their store and their possessions here; for this is not wisdom until the residue of the church, which remaineth in this place, shall go up unto the land of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Behold, it is said in my laws, or forbidden, to get in debt to thine enemies;</p>
    <p id="section-64_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>But behold, it is not said at any time that the Lord should not take when he please, and pay as seemeth him good.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Wherefore, as ye are agents, ye are on the Lord’s errand; and whatever ye do according to the will of the Lord is the Lord’s business.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And he hath set you to provide for his saints in these last days, that they may obtain an inheritance in the land of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And behold, I, the Lord, declare unto you, and my words are sure and shall not fail, that they shall obtain it.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>But all things must come to pass in their time.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And the rebellious shall be cut off out of the land of Zion, and shall be sent away, and shall not inherit the land.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>For, verily I say that the rebellious are not of the blood of Ephraim, wherefore they shall be plucked out.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>Behold, I, the Lord, have made my church in these last days like unto a judge sitting on a hill, or in a high place, to judge the nations.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>For it shall come to pass that the inhabitants of Zion shall judge all things pertaining to Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And liars and hypocrites shall be proved by them, and they who are not apostles and prophets shall be known.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And even the bishop, who is a judge, and his counselors, if they are not faithful in their stewardships shall be condemned, and others shall be planted in their stead.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>For, behold, I say unto you that Zion shall flourish, and the glory of the Lord shall be upon her;</p>
    <p id="section-64_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And she shall be an ensign unto the people, and there shall come unto her out of every nation under heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-64_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And the day shall come when the nations of the earth shall tremble because of her, and shall fear because of her terrible ones. The Lord hath spoken it. Amen.</p>

McLellin—Blessed are you, inasmuch as you have turned away from your iniquities, and have received my truths, saith the Lord your Redeemer, the Savior of the world, even of as many as believe on my name.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Verily I say unto you, blessed are you for receiving mine everlasting covenant, even the fulness of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of men, that they might have life and be made partakers of the glories which are to be revealed in the last days, as it was written by the prophets and apostles in days of old.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Verily I say unto you, my servant William, that you are clean, but not all; repent, therefore, of those things which are not pleasing in my sight, saith the Lord, for the Lord will show them unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And now, verily, I, the Lord, will show unto you what I will concerning you, or what is my will concerning you.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Behold, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should proclaim my gospel from land to land, and from city to city, yea, in those regions round about where it has not been proclaimed.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Tarry not many days in this place; go not up unto the land of Zion as yet; but inasmuch as you can send, send; otherwise, think not of thy property.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Go unto the eastern lands, bear testimony in every place, unto every people and in their synagogues, reasoning with the people.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Let my servant Samuel H. Smith go with you, and forsake him not, and give him thine instructions; and he that is faithful shall be made strong in every place; and I, the Lord, will go with you.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Lay your hands upon the sick, and they shall recover. Return not till I, the Lord, shall send you. Be patient in affliction. Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Seek not to be cumbered. Forsake all unrighteousness. Commit not adultery—a temptation with which thou hast been troubled.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Keep these sayings, for they are true and faithful; and thou shalt magnify thine office, and push many people to Zion with songs of everlasting joy upon their heads.</p>
    <p id="section-66_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Continue in these things even unto the end, and you shall have a crown of eternal life at the right hand of my Father, who is full of grace and truth.</p>

    <p id="section-67_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Behold and hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves together, whose prayers I have heard, and whose hearts I know, and whose desires have come up before me.</p>
    <p id="section-67_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Behold and lo, mine eyes are upon you, and the heavens and the earth are in mine hands, and the riches of eternity are mine to give.</p>
    <p id="section-67_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.</p>
    <p id="section-67_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And now I, the Lord, give unto you a testimony of the truth of these commandments which are lying before you.</p>
    <p id="section-67_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Your eyes have been upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and his language you have known, and his imperfections you have known; and you have sought in your hearts knowledge that you might express beyond his language; this you also know.</p>
    <p id="section-67_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Now, seek ye out of the Book of Commandments, even the least that is among them, and appoint him that is the most wise among you;</p>
    <p id="section-67_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Or, if there be any among you that shall make one like unto it, then ye are justified in saying that ye do not know that they are true;</p>
    <p id="section-67_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But if ye cannot make one like unto it, ye are under condemnation if ye do not bear record that they are true.</p>
    <p id="section-67_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>For ye know that there is no unrighteousness in them, and that which is righteous cometh down from above, from the Father of lights.</p>

    <p id="section-67_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>For no man has seen God at any time in the flesh, except quickened by the Spirit of God.</p>

    <p id="section-67_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Ye are not able to abide the presence of God now, neither the ministering of angels; wherefore, continue in patience until ye are perfected.</p>
    <p id="section-67_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Let not your minds turn back; and when ye are worthy, in mine own due time, ye shall see and know that which was conferred upon you by the hands of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-68" class="chapter-title">Section 68</h2>
    <p id="section-68_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>My servant, Orson Hyde, was called by his ordination to proclaim the everlasting gospel, by the Spirit of the living God, from people to people, and from land to land, in the congregations of the wicked, in their synagogues, reasoning with and expounding all scriptures unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And, behold, and lo, this is an ensample unto all those who were ordained unto this priesthood, whose mission is appointed unto them to go forth—</p>
    <p id="section-68_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And this is the ensample unto them, that they shall speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Behold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>This is the word of the Lord unto you, my servant Orson Hyde, and also unto my servant Luke Johnson, and unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my servant William E.

    <p id="section-68_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Go ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature, acting in the authority which I have given you, baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And he that believeth shall be blest with signs following, even as it is written.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And unto you it shall be given to know the signs of the times, and the signs of the coming of the Son of Man;</p>
    <p id="section-68_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And of as many as the Father shall bear record, to you shall be given power to seal them up unto eternal life. Amen.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And now, concerning the items in addition to the covenants and commandments, they are these—</p>
    <p id="section-68_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>There remain hereafter, in the due time of the Lord, other bishops to be set apart unto the church, to minister even according to the first;</p>
    <p id="section-68_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Wherefore they shall be high priests who are worthy, and they shall be appointed by the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood, except they be literal descendants of Aaron.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And if they be literal descendants of Aaron they have a legal right to the bishopric, if they are the firstborn among the sons of Aaron;</p>
    <p id="section-68_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For the firstborn holds the right of the presidency over this priesthood, and the keys or authority of the same.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>No man has a legal right to this office, to hold the keys of this priesthood, except he be a literal descendant and the firstborn of Aaron.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>But, as a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices he may officiate in the office of bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power, under the hands of the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And a literal descendant of Aaron, also, must be designated by this Presidency, and found worthy, and anointed, and ordained under the hands of this Presidency, otherwise they are not legally authorized to officiate in their priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>But, by virtue of the decree concerning their right of the priesthood descending from father to son, they may claim their anointing if at any time they can prove their lineage, or do ascertain it by revelation from the Lord under the hands of the above named Presidency.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And again, no bishop or high priest who shall be set apart for this ministry shall be tried or condemned for any crime, save it be before the First Presidency of the church;</p>
    <p id="section-68_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And inasmuch as he is found guilty before this Presidency, by testimony that cannot be impeached, he shall be condemned;</p>
    <p id="section-68_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And if he repent he shall be forgiven, according to the covenants and commandments of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their labors, inasmuch as they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness; for the idler shall be had in remembrance before the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among them; and their children are also growing up in wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>These things ought not to be, and must be done away from among them; wherefore, let my servant Oliver Cowdery carry these sayings unto the land of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And a commandment I give unto them—that he that observeth not his prayers before the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in remembrance before the judge of my people.</p>
    <p id="section-68_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>These sayings are true and faithful; wherefore, transgress them not, neither take therefrom.</p>

    <p id="section-69_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Wherefore, I, the Lord, will that my servant, John Whitmer, should go with my servant Oliver Cowdery;</p>

    <p id="section-70_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For I give unto them a commandment; wherefore hearken and hear, for thus saith the Lord unto them—</p>
    <p id="section-70_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>I, the Lord, have appointed them, and ordained them to be stewards over the revelations and commandments which I have given unto them, and which I shall hereafter give unto them;</p>

    <h2 id="section-72" class="chapter-title">Section 72</h2>
    <p id="section-72_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hearken, and listen to the voice of the Lord, O ye who have assembled yourselves together, who are the high priests of my church, to whom the kingdom and power have been given.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For verily thus saith the Lord, it is expedient in me for a bishop to be appointed unto you, or of you, unto the church in this part of the Lord’s vineyard.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And verily in this thing ye have done wisely, for it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For he who is faithful and wise in time is accounted worthy to inherit the mansions prepared for him of my Father.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Verily I say unto you, the elders of the church in this part of my vineyard shall render an account of their stewardship unto the bishop, who shall be appointed of me in this part of my vineyard.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>These things shall be had on record, to be handed over unto the bishop in Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And the duty of the bishop shall be made known by the commandments which have been given, and the voice of the conference.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, my servant Newel K. Whitney is the man who shall be appointed and ordained unto this power. This is the will of the Lord your God, your Redeemer. Even so. Amen.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>The word of the Lord, in addition to the law which has been given, making known the duty of the bishop who has been ordained unto the church in this part of the vineyard, which is verily this—</p>
    <p id="section-72_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>To keep the Lord’s storehouse; to receive the funds of the church in this part of the vineyard;</p>
    <p id="section-72_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>To take an account of the elders as before has been commanded; and to administer to their wants, who shall pay for that which they receive, inasmuch as they have wherewith to pay;</p>
    <p id="section-72_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>That this also may be consecrated to the good of the church, to the poor and needy.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And he who hath not wherewith to pay, an account shall be taken and handed over to the bishop of Zion, who shall pay the debt out of that which the Lord shall put into his hands.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And the labors of the faithful who labor in spiritual things, in administering the gospel and the things of the kingdom unto the church, and unto the world, shall answer the debt unto the bishop in Zion;</p>
    <p id="section-72_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Thus it cometh out of the church, for according to the law every man that cometh up to Zion must lay all things before the bishop in Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, that as every elder in this part of the vineyard must give an account of his stewardship unto the bishop in this part of the vineyard—</p>
    <p id="section-72_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>A certificate from the judge or bishop in this part of the vineyard, unto the bishop in Zion, rendereth every man acceptable, and answereth all things, for an inheritance, and to be received as a wise steward and as a faithful laborer;</p>
    <p id="section-72_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Otherwise he shall not be accepted of the bishop of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, let every elder who shall give an account unto the bishop of the church in this part of the vineyard be recommended by the church or churches, in which he labors, that he may render himself and his accounts approved in all things.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And again, let my servants who are appointed as stewards over the literary concerns of my church have claim for assistance upon the bishop or bishops in all things—</p>
    <p id="section-72_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>That the revelations may be published, and go forth unto the ends of the earth; that they also may obtain funds which shall benefit the church in all things;</p>
    <p id="section-72_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>That they also may render themselves approved in all things, and be accounted as wise stewards.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And now, behold, this shall be an ensample for all the extensive branches of my church, in whatsoever land they shall be established. And now I make an end of my sayings. Amen.</p>
    <p id="section-72_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>A few words in addition to the laws of the kingdom, respecting the members of the church—they that are appointed by the Holy Spirit to go up unto Zion, and they who are privileged to go up unto Zion—</p>
    <p id="section-72_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Let them carry up unto the bishop a certificate from three elders of the church, or a certificate from the bishop;</p>
    <p id="section-72_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Otherwise he who shall go up unto the land of Zion shall not be accounted as a wise steward. This is also an ensample. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-73_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>For verily, thus saith the Lord, it is expedient in me that they should continue preaching the gospel, and in exhortation to the churches in the regions round about, until conference;</p>

    <h2 id="section-74" class="chapter-title">Section 74</h2>
    <p id="section-74_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</p>
    <p id="section-74_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Now, in the days of the apostles the law of circumcision was had among all the Jews who believed not the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p id="section-74_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And it came to pass that there arose a great contention among the people concerning the law of circumcision, for the unbelieving husband was desirous that his children should be circumcised and become subject to the law of Moses, which law was fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-74_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And it came to pass that the children, being brought up in subjection to the law of Moses, gave heed to the traditions of their fathers and believed not the gospel of Christ, wherein they became unholy.</p>
    <p id="section-74_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Wherefore, for this cause the apostle wrote unto the church, giving unto them a commandment, not of the Lord, but of himself, that a believer should not be united to an unbeliever; except the law of Moses should be done away among them,</p>
    <p id="section-74_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>That their children might remain without circumcision; and that the tradition might be done away, which saith that little children are unholy; for it was had among the Jews;</p>
    <p id="section-74_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>But little children are holy, being sanctified through the atonement of Jesus Christ; and this is what the scriptures mean.</p>

    <p id="section-75_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I who speak even by the voice of my Spirit, even Alpha and Omega, your Lord and your God—</p>
    <p id="section-75_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Hearken, O ye who have given your names to go forth to proclaim my gospel, and to prune my vineyard.</p>
    <p id="section-75_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Behold, I say unto you that it is my will that you should go forth and not tarry, neither be idle but labor with your might—</p>
    <p id="section-75_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, proclaiming the truth according to the revelations and commandments which I have given you.</p>
    <p id="section-75_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And thus, if ye are faithful ye shall be laden with many sheaves, and crowned with honor, and glory, and immortality, and eternal life.</p>
    <p id="section-75_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Therefore, verily I say unto my servant William E. McLellin, I revoke the commission which I gave unto him to go unto the eastern countries;</p>
    <p id="section-75_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And I give unto him a new commission and a new commandment, in the which I, the Lord, chasten him for the murmurings of his heart;</p>
    <p id="section-75_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And he sinned; nevertheless, I forgive him and say unto him again, Go ye into the south countries.</p>
    <p id="section-75_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And let my servant Luke Johnson go with him, and proclaim the things which I have commanded them—</p>

    <p id="section-75_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And again, verily thus saith the Lord, let my servant Orson Hyde and my servant Samuel H.

    <p id="section-75_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And again, verily I say unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my servant Orson Pratt, they shall also take their journey into the eastern countries; and behold, and lo, I am with them also, even unto the end.</p>

    <p id="section-75_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And again, thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye elders of my church, who have given your names that you might know his will concerning you—</p>
    <p id="section-75_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Behold, I say unto you, that it is the duty of the church to assist in supporting the families of those, and also to support the families of those who are called and must needs be sent unto the world to proclaim the gospel unto the world.</p>
    <p id="section-75_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Wherefore, I, the Lord, give unto you this commandment, that ye obtain places for your families, inasmuch as your brethren are willing to open their hearts.</p>
    <p id="section-75_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And let all such as can obtain places for their families, and support of the church for them, not fail to go into the world, whether to the east or to the west, or to the north, or to the south.</p>
    <p id="section-75_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Let them ask and they shall receive, knock and it shall be opened unto them, and be made known from on high, even by the Comforter, whither they shall go.</p>
    <p id="section-75_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, that every man who is obliged to provide for his own family, let him provide, and he shall in nowise lose his crown; and let him labor in the church.</p>
    <p id="section-75_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Let every man be diligent in all things. And the idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways.</p>

    <h2 id="section-76" class="chapter-title">Section 76</h2>
    <p id="section-76_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his doings none can find out.</p>

    <p id="section-76_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>For thus saith the Lord—I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom.</p>

    <p id="section-76_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will—yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>We, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, being in the Spirit on the sixteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two—</p>
    <p id="section-76_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>By the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see and understand the things of God—</p>
    <p id="section-76_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Even those things which were from the beginning before the world was, which were ordained of the Father, through his Only Begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, even from the beginning;</p>
    <p id="section-76_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Of whom we bear record; and the record which we bear is the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, who is the Son, whom we saw and with whom we conversed in the heavenly vision.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>For while we were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us, we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John, which was given unto us as follows—</p>
    <p id="section-76_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Speaking of the resurrection of the dead, concerning those who shall hear the voice of the Son of Man:</p>
    <p id="section-76_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; and they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Now this caused us to marvel, for it was given unto us of the Spirit.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And while we meditated upon these things, the Lord touched the eyes of our understandings and they were opened, and the glory of the Lord shone round about.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his fulness;</p>
    <p id="section-76_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before his throne, worshiping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</p>
    <p id="section-76_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father—</p>
    <p id="section-76_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son,</p>
    <p id="section-76_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him—he was Lucifer, a son of the morning.</p>
    <p id="section-76_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen, even a son of the morning!</p>
    <p id="section-76_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the vision; for we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ—</p>

    <p id="section-76_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And we saw a vision of the sufferings of those with whom he made war and overcame, for thus came the voice of the Lord unto us:</p>
    <p id="section-76_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Thus saith the Lord concerning all those who know my power, and have been made partakers thereof, and suffered themselves through the power of the devil to be overcome, and to deny the truth and defy my power—</p>

    <p id="section-77_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Q. What is the sea of glass spoken of by John, 4th chapter, and 6th verse of the Revelation?<br/>
    A. It is the earth, in its sanctified, immortal, and eternal state.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Q. What are we to understand by the four beasts, spoken of in the same verse?<br/>
    A. They are figurative expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in describing heaven, the paradise of God, the happiness of man, and of beasts, and of creeping things, and of the fowls of the air; that which is spiritual being in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other creature which God has created.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Q. Are the four beasts limited to individual beasts, or do they represent classes or orders?<br/>
    A. They are limited to four individual beasts, which were shown to John, to represent the glory of the classes of beings in their destined order or sphere of creation, in the enjoyment of their eternal felicity.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Q. What are we to understand by the eyes and wings, which the beasts had?<br/>
    A. Their eyes are a representation of light and knowledge, that is, they are full of knowledge; and their wings are a representation of power, to move, to act, etc.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Q. What are we to understand by the four and twenty elders, spoken of by John?<br/>

    <p id="section-77_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Q. What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed on the back with seven seals?<br/>
    A. We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Q. What are we to understand by the seven seals with which it was sealed?<br/>
    A. We are to understand that the first seal contains the things of the first thousand years, and the second also of the second thousand years, and so on until the seventh.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Q. What are we to understand by the four angels, spoken of in the 7th chapter and 1st verse of Revelation?<br/>
    A. We are to understand that they are four angels sent forth from God, to whom is given power over the four parts of the earth, to save life and to destroy; these are they who have the everlasting gospel to commit to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; having power to shut up the heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the regions of darkness.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Q. What are we to understand by the angel ascending from the east, Revelation 7th chapter and 2nd verse?<br/>
    A. We are to understand that the angel ascending from the east is he to whom is given the seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore, he crieth unto the four angels having the everlasting gospel, saying: Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And, if you will receive it, this is Elias which was to come to gather together the tribes of Israel and restore all things.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Q. What time are the things spoken of in this chapter to be accomplished?<br/>
    A. They are to be accomplished in the sixth thousand years, or the opening of the sixth seal.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Q. What are we to understand by sealing the one hundred and forty-four thousand, out of all the tribes of Israel—twelve thousand out of every tribe?<br/>
    A. We are to understand that those who are sealed are high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Q. What are we to understand by the sounding of the trumpets, mentioned in the 8th chapter of Revelation?<br/>
    A. We are to understand that as God made the world in six days, and on the seventh day he finished his work, and sanctified it, and also formed man out of the dust of the earth, even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years will the Lord God sanctify the earth, and complete the salvation of man, and judge all things, and shall redeem all things, except that which he hath not put into his power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the end of all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels are the preparing and finishing of his work, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years—the preparing of the way before the time of his coming.</p>
    <p id="section-77_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Q. When are the things to be accomplished, which are written in the 9th chapter of Revelation?<br/>
    A. They are to be accomplished after the opening of the seventh seal, before the coming of Christ.</p>

    <p id="section-77_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Q. What is to be understood by the two witnesses, in the eleventh chapter of Revelation?<br/>

    <p id="section-78_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And listen to the counsel of him who has ordained you from on high, who shall speak in your ears the words of wisdom, that salvation may be unto you in that thing which you have presented before me, saith the Lord God.</p>
    <p id="section-78_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>For verily I say unto you, the time has come, and is now at hand; and behold, and lo, it must needs be that there be an organization of my people, in regulating and establishing the affairs of the storehouse for the poor of my people, both in this place and in the land of Zion—</p>
    <p id="section-78_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For a permanent and everlasting establishment and order unto my church, to advance the cause, which ye have espoused, to the salvation of man, and to the glory of your Father who is in heaven;</p>
    <p id="section-78_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>That you may be equal in the bonds of heavenly things, yea, and earthly things also, for the obtaining of heavenly things.</p>
    <p id="section-78_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>For if ye are not equal in earthly things ye cannot be equal in obtaining heavenly things;</p>
    <p id="section-78_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>For if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you.</p>
    <p id="section-78_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And now, verily thus saith the Lord, it is expedient that all things be done unto my glory, by you who are joined together in this order;</p>

    <p id="section-78_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Otherwise Satan seeketh to turn their hearts away from the truth, that they become blinded and understand not the things which are prepared for them.</p>
    <p id="section-78_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, to prepare and organize yourselves by a bond or everlasting covenant that cannot be broken.</p>
    <p id="section-78_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And he who breaketh it shall lose his office and standing in the church, and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.</p>
    <p id="section-78_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Behold, this is the preparation wherewith I prepare you, and the foundation, and the ensample which I give unto you, whereby you may accomplish the commandments which are given you;</p>
    <p id="section-78_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>That through my providence, notwithstanding the tribulation which shall descend upon you, that the church may stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world;</p>
    <p id="section-78_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>That you may come up unto the crown prepared for you, and be made rulers over many kingdoms, saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Zion, who hath established the foundations of Adam-ondi-Ahman;</p>
    <p id="section-78_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Who hath appointed Michael your prince, and established his feet, and set him upon high, and given unto him the keys of salvation under the counsel and direction of the Holy One, who is without beginning of days or end of life.</p>
    <p id="section-78_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</p>
    <p id="section-78_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.</p>
    <p id="section-78_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.</p>
    <p id="section-78_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Wherefore, do the things which I have commanded you, saith your Redeemer, even the Son Ahman, who prepareth all things before he taketh you;</p>
    <p id="section-78_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>For ye are the church of the Firstborn, and he will take you up in a cloud, and appoint every man his portion.</p>

    <p id="section-82_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, my servants, that inasmuch as you have forgiven one another your trespasses, even so I, the Lord, forgive you.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Nevertheless, there are those among you who have sinned exceedingly; yea, even all of you have sinned; but verily I say unto you, beware from henceforth, and refrain from sin, lest sore judgments fall upon your heads.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>For of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Ye call upon my name for revelations, and I give them unto you; and inasmuch as ye keep not my sayings, which I give unto you, ye become transgressors; and justice and judgment are the penalty which is affixed unto my law.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Therefore, what I say unto one I say unto all: Watch, for the adversary spreadeth his dominions, and darkness reigneth;</p>
    <p id="section-82_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And the anger of God kindleth against the inhabitants of the earth; and none doeth good, for all have gone out of the way.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, will not lay any sin to your charge; go your ways and sin no more; but unto that soul who sinneth shall the former sins return, saith the Lord your God.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a new commandment, that you may understand my will concerning you;</p>
    <p id="section-82_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Or, in other words, I give unto you directions how you may act before me, that it may turn to you for your salvation.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Therefore, verily I say unto you, that it is expedient for my servants Edward Partridge and Newel K.

    <p id="section-82_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Therefore, I give unto you this commandment, that ye bind yourselves by this covenant, and it shall be done according to the laws of the Lord.</p>

    <p id="section-82_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And you are to be equal, or in other words, you are to have equal claims on the properties, for the benefit of managing the concerns of your stewardships, every man according to his wants and his needs, inasmuch as his wants are just—</p>

    <p id="section-82_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>This order I have appointed to be an everlasting order unto you, and unto your successors, inasmuch as you sin not.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And the soul that sins against this covenant, and hardeneth his heart against it, shall be dealt with according to the laws of my church, and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, and this is wisdom, make unto yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, and they will not destroy you.</p>
    <p id="section-82_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Leave judgment alone with me, for it is mine and I will repay. Peace be with you; my blessings continue with you.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church, established in the last days for the restoration of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to stand upon Mount Zion, which shall be the city of New Jerusalem.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Which priesthood continueth in the church of God in all generations, and is without beginning of days or end of years.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And the Lord confirmed a priesthood also upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations, which priesthood also continueth and abideth forever with the priesthood which is after the holiest order of God.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>For without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Now this Moses plainly taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God;</p>
    <p id="section-84_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Therefore, he took Moses out of their midst, and the Holy Priesthood also;</p>
    <p id="section-84_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And the lesser priesthood continued, which priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel;</p>
    <p id="section-84_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Which gospel is the gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins, and the law of carnal commandments, which the Lord in his wrath caused to continue with the house of Aaron among the children of Israel until John, whom God raised up, being filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother’s womb.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>For he was baptized while he was yet in his childhood, and was ordained by the angel of God at the time he was eight days old unto this power, to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews, and to make straight the way of the Lord before the face of his people, to prepare them for the coming of the Lord, in whose hand is given all power.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And again, the offices of elder and bishop are necessary appendages belonging unto the high priesthood.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Therefore, as I said concerning the sons of Moses—for the sons of Moses and also the sons of Aaron shall offer an acceptable offering and sacrifice in the house of the Lord, which house shall be built unto the Lord in this generation, upon the consecrated spot as I have appointed—</p>
    <p id="section-84_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And the sons of Moses and of Aaron shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, upon Mount Zion in the Lord’s house, whose sons are ye; and also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my church.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because you have treated lightly the things you have received—</p>
    <p id="section-84_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>Which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v73" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">73 </span>But a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not boast themselves of these things, neither speak them before the world; for these things are given unto you for your profit and for salvation.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v74" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, they who believe not on your words, and are not baptized in water in my name, for the remission of their sins, that they may receive the Holy Ghost, shall be damned, and shall not come into my Father’s kingdom where my Father and I am.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v75" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">75 </span>And this revelation unto you, and commandment, is in force from this very hour upon all the world, and the gospel is unto all who have not received it.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v76" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">76 </span>But, verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given—from you it must be preached unto them, that they shall repent of their former evil works; for they are to be upbraided for their evil hearts of unbelief, and your brethren in Zion for their rebellion against you at the time I sent you.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v77" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">77 </span>And again I say unto you, my friends, for from henceforth I shall call you friends, it is expedient that I give unto you this commandment, that ye become even as my friends in days when I was with them, traveling to preach the gospel in my power;</p>
    <p id="section-84_v78" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">78 </span>For I suffered them not to have purse or scrip, neither two coats.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v93" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">93 </span>And in whatsoever village or city ye enter, do likewise.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v103" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">103 </span>And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, it is expedient that every man who goes forth to proclaim mine everlasting gospel, that inasmuch as they have families, and receive money by gift, that they should send it unto them or make use of it for their benefit, as the Lord shall direct them, for thus it seemeth me good.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v104" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">104 </span>And let all those who have not families, who receive money, send it up unto the bishop in Zion, or unto the bishop in Ohio, that it may be consecrated for the bringing forth of the revelations and the printing thereof, and for establishing Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-84_v105" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">105 </span>And if any man shall give unto any of you a coat, or a suit, take the old and cast it unto the poor, and go on your way rejoicing.</p>

    <p id="section-84_v108" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">108 </span>Behold, this is the way that mine apostles, in ancient days, built up my church unto me.</p>

    <p id="section-85_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>It is the duty of the Lord’s clerk, whom he has appointed, to keep a history, and a general church record of all things that transpire in Zion, and of all those who consecrate properties, and receive inheritances legally from the bishop;</p>

    <p id="section-85_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Neither is their genealogy to be kept, or to be had where it may be found on any of the records or history of the church.</p>

    <p id="section-85_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>While that man, who was called of God and appointed, that putteth forth his hand to steady the ark of God, shall fall by the shaft of death, like as a tree that is smitten by the vivid shaft of lightning.</p>

    <p id="section-86_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the tares while the blade is yet tender (for verily your faith is weak), lest you destroy the wheat also.</p>
    <p id="section-86_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Therefore, let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo, the tares are bound in bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.</p>
    <p id="section-86_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers—</p>

    <p id="section-87_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually terminate in the death and misery of many souls;</p>
    <p id="section-87_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And the time will come that war will be poured out upon all nations, beginning at this place.</p>
    <p id="section-87_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>For behold, the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States, and the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great Britain, as it is called, and they shall also call upon other nations, in order to defend themselves against other nations; and then war shall be poured out upon all nations.</p>
    <p id="section-87_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise up against their masters, who shall be marshaled and disciplined for war.</p>
    <p id="section-87_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And it shall come to pass also that the remnants who are left of the land will marshal themselves, and shall become exceedingly angry, and shall vex the Gentiles with a sore vexation.</p>

    <h2 id="section-88" class="chapter-title">Section 88</h2>
    <p id="section-88_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you who have assembled yourselves together to receive his will concerning you:</p>
    <p id="section-88_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Behold, this is pleasing unto your Lord, and the angels rejoice over you; the alms of your prayers have come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded in the book of the names of the sanctified, even them of the celestial world.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Wherefore, I now send upon you another Comforter, even upon you my friends, that it may abide in your hearts, even the Holy Spirit of promise; which other Comforter is the same that I promised unto my disciples, as is recorded in the testimony of John.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>This Comforter is the promise which I give unto you of eternal life, even the glory of the celestial kingdom;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Which glory is that of the church of the Firstborn, even of God, the holiest of all, through Jesus Christ his Son—</p>
    <p id="section-88_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all things, the light of truth;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Which truth shineth. This is the light of Christ. As also he is in the sun, and the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>As also he is in the moon, and is the light of the moon, and the power thereof by which it was made;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>As also the light of the stars, and the power thereof by which they were made;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And the earth also, and the power thereof, even the earth upon which you stand.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space—</p>
    <p id="section-88_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Now, verily I say unto you, that through the redemption which is made for you is brought to pass the resurrection from the dead.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And the spirit and the body are the soul of man.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things, in whose bosom it is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall inherit it.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Therefore, it must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for the celestial glory;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>For after it hath filled the measure of its creation, it shall be crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the Father;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>That bodies who are of the celestial kingdom may possess it forever and ever; for, for this intent was it made and created, and for this intent are they sanctified.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And they who are not sanctified through the law which I have given unto you, even the law of Christ, must inherit another kingdom, even that of a terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom cannot abide a terrestrial glory.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom cannot abide a telestial glory; therefore he is not meet for a kingdom of glory. Therefore he must abide a kingdom which is not a kingdom of glory.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, the earth abideth the law of a celestial kingdom, for it filleth the measure of its creation, and transgresseth not the law—</p>
    <p id="section-88_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Wherefore, it shall be sanctified; yea, notwithstanding it shall die, it shall be quickened again, and shall abide the power by which it is quickened, and the righteous shall inherit it.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>For notwithstanding they die, they also shall rise again, a spiritual body.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>They who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which was a natural body; even ye shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall be that glory by which your bodies are quickened.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Ye who are quickened by a portion of the celestial glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And they who are quickened by a portion of the terrestrial glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And also they who are quickened by a portion of the telestial glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And they who remain shall also be quickened; nevertheless, they shall return again to their own place, to enjoy that which they are willing to receive, because they were not willing to enjoy that which they might have received.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, that which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, they must remain filthy still.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>All kingdoms have a law given;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And there are many kingdoms; for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space, either a greater or a lesser kingdom.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own; justice continueth its course and claimeth its own; judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon the throne and governeth and executeth all things.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>He comprehendeth all things, and all things are before him, and all things are round about him; and he is above all things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things; and all things are by him, and of him, even God, forever and ever.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, he hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And their courses are fixed, even the courses of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the earth and all the planets.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And they give light to each other in their times and in their seasons, in their minutes, in their hours, in their days, in their weeks, in their months, in their years—all these are one year with God, but not with man.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand?</p>
    <p id="section-88_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>I say unto you, he hath seen him; nevertheless, he who came unto his own was not comprehended.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not; nevertheless, the day shall come when you shall comprehend even God, being quickened in him and by him.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>Then shall ye know that ye have seen me, that I am, and that I am the true light that is in you, and that you are in me; otherwise ye could not abound.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>Behold, I will liken these kingdoms unto a man having a field, and he sent forth his servants into the field to dig in the field.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And he said unto the first: Go ye and labor in the field, and in the first hour I will come unto you, and ye shall behold the joy of my countenance.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>And he said unto the second: Go ye also into the field, and in the second hour I will visit you with the joy of my countenance.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And also unto the third, saying: I will visit you;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And unto the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And the lord of the field went unto the first in the first hour, and tarried with him all that hour, and he was made glad with the light of the countenance of his lord.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>And then he withdrew from the first that he might visit the second also, and the third, and the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>And thus they all received the light of the countenance of their lord, every man in his hour, and in his time, and in his season—</p>
    <p id="section-88_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>Beginning at the first, and so on unto the last, and from the last unto the first, and from the first unto the last;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>Every man in his own order, until his hour was finished, even according as his lord had commanded him, that his lord might be glorified in him, and he in his lord, that they all might be glorified.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>Therefore, unto this parable I will liken all these kingdoms, and the inhabitants thereof—every kingdom in its hour, and in its time, and in its season, even according to the decree which God hath made.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, my friends, I leave these sayings with you to ponder in your hearts, with this commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall call upon me while I am near—</p>
    <p id="section-88_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that is expedient for you;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>And if ye ask anything that is not expedient for you, it shall turn unto your condemnation.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>Behold, that which you hear is as the voice of one crying in the wilderness—in the wilderness, because you cannot see him—my voice, because my voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you it shall abound.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v69" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69 </span>Remember the great and last promise which I have made unto you; cast away your idle thoughts and your excess of laughter far from you.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v70" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70 </span>Tarry ye, tarry ye in this place, and call a solemn assembly, even of those who are the first laborers in this last kingdom.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v71" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71 </span>And let those whom they have warned in their traveling call on the Lord, and ponder the warning in their hearts which they have received, for a little season.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v72" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72 </span>Behold, and lo, I will take care of your flocks, and will raise up elders and send unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v73" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">73 </span>Behold, I will hasten my work in its time.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v74" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74 </span>And I give unto you, who are the first laborers in this last kingdom, a commandment that you assemble yourselves together, and organize yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v75" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">75 </span>That I may testify unto your Father, and your God, and my God, that you are clean from the blood of this wicked generation; that I may fulfil this promise, this great and last promise, which I have made unto you, when I will.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v76" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">76 </span>Also, I give unto you a commandment that ye shall continue in prayer and fasting from this time forth.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v77" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">77 </span>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v78" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">78 </span>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v79" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">79 </span>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms—</p>
    <p id="section-88_v80" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">80 </span>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v81" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">81 </span>Behold, I sent you out to testify and warn the people, and it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v82" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">82 </span>Therefore, they are left without excuse, and their sins are upon their own heads.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v83" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">83 </span>He that seeketh me early shall find me, and shall not be forsaken.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v84" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">84 </span>Therefore, tarry ye, and labor diligently, that you may be perfected in your ministry to go forth among the Gentiles for the last time, as many as the mouth of the Lord shall name, to bind up the law and seal up the testimony, and to prepare the saints for the hour of judgment which is to come;</p>
    <p id="section-88_v85" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">85 </span>That their souls may escape the wrath of God, the desolation of abomination which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come. Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the first elders continue in the vineyard until the mouth of the Lord shall call them, for their time is not yet come; their garments are not clean from the blood of this generation.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v86" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">86 </span>Abide ye in the liberty wherewith ye are made free; entangle not yourselves in sin, but let your hands be clean, until the Lord comes.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v87" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">87 </span>For not many days hence and the earth shall tremble and reel to and fro as a drunken man; and the sun shall hide his face, and shall refuse to give light; and the moon shall be bathed in blood; and the stars shall become exceedingly angry, and shall cast themselves down as a fig that falleth from off a fig tree.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v88" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">88 </span>And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the people.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v89" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">89 </span>For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and shall not be able to stand.</p>

    <p id="section-88_v91" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">91 </span>And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men’s hearts shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v92" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">92 </span>And angels shall fly through the midst of heaven, crying with a loud voice, sounding the trump of God, saying: Prepare ye, prepare ye, O inhabitants of the earth; for the judgment of our God is come.

    <p id="section-88_v93" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">93 </span>And immediately there shall appear a great sign in heaven, and all people shall see it together.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v94" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">94 </span>And another angel shall sound his trump, saying: That great church, the mother of abominations, that made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, that persecuteth the saints of God, that shed their blood—she who sitteth upon many waters, and upon the islands of the sea—behold, she is the tares of the earth; she is bound in bundles; her bands are made strong, no man can loose them; therefore, she is ready to be burned. And he shall sound his trump both long and loud, and all nations shall hear it.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v95" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">95 </span>And there shall be silence in heaven for the space of half an hour; and immediately after shall the curtain of heaven be unfolded, as a scroll is unfolded after it is rolled up, and the face of the Lord shall be unveiled;</p>

    <p id="section-88_v99" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">99 </span>And after this another angel shall sound, which is the second trump; and then cometh the redemption of those who are Christ’s at his coming; who have received their part in that prison which is prepared for them, that they might receive the gospel, and be judged according to men in the flesh.</p>
    <p id="section-88_v100" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">100 </span>And again, another trump shall sound, which is the third trump; and then come the spirits of men who are to be judged, and are found under condemnation;</p>

    <p id="section-88_v105" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">105 </span>And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the sixth angel, saying: She is fallen who made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; she is fallen, is fallen!</p>

    <p id="section-89_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>A <span class="small-caps">Word of Wisdom</span>, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion—</p>
    <p id="section-89_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days—</p>
    <p id="section-89_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation—</p>
    <p id="section-89_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man—</p>
    <p id="section-89_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly;</p>
    <p id="section-89_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth;</p>
    <p id="section-89_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and excess of hunger.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground—</p>
    <p id="section-89_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain.</p>
    <p id="section-89_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</p>

    <h2 id="section-90" class="chapter-title">Section 90</h2>
    <p id="section-90_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Thus saith the Lord, verily, verily I say unto you my son, thy sins are forgiven thee, according to thy petition, for thy prayers and the prayers of thy brethren have come up into my ears.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Therefore, thou art blessed from henceforth that bear the keys of the kingdom given unto you; which kingdom is coming forth for the last time.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Verily I say unto you, the keys of this kingdom shall never be taken from you, while thou art in the world, neither in the world to come;</p>
    <p id="section-90_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Nevertheless, through you shall the oracles be given to another, yea, even unto the church.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And all they who receive the oracles of God, let them beware how they hold them lest they are accounted as a light thing, and are brought under condemnation thereby, and stumble and fall when the storms descend, and the winds blow, and the rains descend, and beat upon their house.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And again, verily I say unto thy brethren, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams, their sins are forgiven them also, and they are accounted as equal with thee in holding the keys of this last kingdom;</p>
    <p id="section-90_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>As also through your administration the keys of the school of the prophets, which I have commanded to be organized;</p>
    <p id="section-90_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>That thereby they may be perfected in their ministry for the salvation of Zion, and of the nations of Israel, and of the Gentiles, as many as will believe;</p>
    <p id="section-90_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>That through your administration they may receive the word, and through their administration the word may go forth unto the ends of the earth, unto the Gentiles first, and then, behold, and lo, they shall turn unto the Jews.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And then cometh the day when the arm of the Lord shall be revealed in power in convincing the nations, the heathen nations, the house of Joseph, of the gospel of their salvation.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>For it shall come to pass in that day, that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power, by the administration of the Comforter, shed forth upon them for the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment that you continue in the ministry and presidency.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And when you have finished the translation of the prophets, you shall from thenceforth preside over the affairs of the church and the school;</p>
    <p id="section-90_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And from time to time, as shall be manifested by the Comforter, receive revelations to unfold the mysteries of the kingdom;</p>
    <p id="section-90_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And set in order the churches, and study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And this shall be your business and mission in all your lives, to preside in council, and set in order all the affairs of this church and kingdom.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Be not ashamed, neither confounded; but be admonished in all your high-mindedness and pride, for it bringeth a snare upon your souls.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Set in order your houses; keep slothfulness and uncleanness far from you.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Now, verily I say unto you, let there be a place provided, as soon as it is possible, for the family of thy counselor and scribe, even Frederick G. Williams.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And let mine aged servant, Joseph Smith, Sen., continue with his family upon the place where he now lives; and let it not be sold until the mouth of the Lord shall name.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And let my counselor, even Sidney Rigdon, remain where he now resides until the mouth of the Lord shall name.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And let the bishop search diligently to obtain an agent, and let him be a man who has got riches in store—a man of God, and of strong faith—</p>
    <p id="section-90_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>That thereby he may be enabled to discharge every debt; that the storehouse of the Lord may not be brought into disrepute before the eyes of the people.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Let your families be small, especially mine aged servant Joseph Smith’s, Sen., as pertaining to those who do not belong to your families;</p>
    <p id="section-90_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>That those things that are provided for you, to bring to pass my work, be not taken from you and given to those that are not worthy—</p>
    <p id="section-90_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And thereby you be hindered in accomplishing those things which I have commanded you.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, it is my will that my handmaid Vienna Jaques should receive money to bear her expenses, and go up unto the land of Zion;</p>
    <p id="section-90_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And the residue of the money may be consecrated unto me, and she be rewarded in mine own due time.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Verily I say unto you, that it is meet in mine eyes that she should go up unto the land of Zion, and receive an inheritance from the hand of the bishop;</p>
    <p id="section-90_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>That she may settle down in peace inasmuch as she is faithful, and not be idle in her days from thenceforth.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And behold, verily I say unto you, that ye shall write this commandment, and say unto your brethren in Zion, in love greeting, that I have called you also to preside over Zion in mine own due time.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Therefore, let them cease wearying me concerning this matter.</p>
    <p id="section-90_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Behold, I say unto you that your brethren in Zion begin to repent, and the angels rejoice over them.</p>

    <p id="section-93_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>I was in the world and received of my Father, and the works of him were plainly manifest.</p>
    <p id="section-93_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And John saw and bore record of the fulness of my glory, and the fulness of John’s record is hereafter to be revealed.</p>

    <p id="section-93_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>Your family must needs repent and forsake some things, and give more earnest heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place.</p>

    <p id="section-93_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>Now, I say unto you, my friends, let my servant Sidney Rigdon go on his journey, and make haste, and also proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the gospel of salvation, as I shall give him utterance; and by your prayer of faith with one consent I will uphold him.</p>
    <p id="section-93_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Frederick G.

    <p id="section-93_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>And, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should hasten to translate my scriptures, and to obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion.

    <p id="section-97_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily I say unto you my friends, I speak unto you with my voice, even the voice of my Spirit, that I may show unto you my will concerning your brethren in the land of Zion, many of whom are truly humble and are seeking diligently to learn wisdom and to find truth.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Verily, verily I say unto you, blessed are such, for they shall obtain; for I, the Lord, show mercy unto all the meek, and upon all whomsoever I will, that I may be justified when I shall bring them unto judgment.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Behold, I say unto you, concerning the school in Zion, I, the Lord, am well pleased that there should be a school in Zion, and also with my servant Parley P. Pratt, for he abideth in me.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And inasmuch as he continueth to abide in me he shall continue to preside over the school in the land of Zion until I shall give unto him other commandments.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings, in expounding all scriptures and mysteries to the edification of the school, and of the church in Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And to the residue of the school, I, the Lord, am willing to show mercy; nevertheless, there are those that must needs be chastened, and their works shall be made known.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>The ax is laid at the root of the trees; and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire. I, the Lord, have spoken it.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice—yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command—they are accepted of me.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that a house should be built unto me in the land of Zion, like unto the pattern which I have given you.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Yea, let it be built speedily, by the tithing of my people.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Behold, this is the tithing and the sacrifice which I, the Lord, require at their hands, that there may be a house built unto me for the salvation of Zion—</p>
    <p id="section-97_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>For a place of thanksgiving for all saints, and for a place of instruction for all those who are called to the work of the ministry in all their several callings and offices;</p>
    <p id="section-97_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>That they may be perfected in the understanding of their ministry, in theory, in principle, and in doctrine, in all things pertaining to the kingdom of God on the earth, the keys of which kingdom have been conferred upon you.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And inasmuch as my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord, and do not suffer any unclean thing to come into it, that it be not defiled, my glory shall rest upon it;</p>
    <p id="section-97_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come into it, and all the pure in heart that shall come into it shall see God.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>But if it be defiled I will not come into it, and my glory shall not be there; for I will not come into unholy temples.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And, now, behold, if Zion do these things she shall prosper, and spread herself and become very glorious, very great, and very terrible.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And the nations of the earth shall honor her, and shall say: Surely Zion is the city of our God, and surely Zion cannot fall, neither be moved out of her place, for God is there, and the hand of the Lord is there;</p>
    <p id="section-97_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And he hath sworn by the power of his might to be her salvation and her high tower.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion—<span class="small-caps">the pure in heart</span>; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall mourn.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>For behold, and lo, vengeance cometh speedily upon the ungodly as the whirlwind; and who shall escape it?</p>
    <p id="section-97_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>The Lord’s scourge shall pass over by night and by day, and the report thereof shall vex all people; yea, it shall not be stayed until the Lord come;</p>
    <p id="section-97_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>For the indignation of the Lord is kindled against their abominations and all their wicked works.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Nevertheless, Zion shall escape if she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded her.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>But if she observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will visit her according to all her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence, with plague, with sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire.</p>
    <p id="section-97_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Nevertheless, let it be read this once to her ears, that I, the Lord, have accepted of her offering; and if she sin no more none of these things shall come upon her;</p>
    <p id="section-97_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And I will bless her with blessings, and multiply a multiplicity of blessings upon her, and upon her generations forever and ever, saith the Lord your God. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-98" class="chapter-title">Section 98</h2>
    <p id="section-98_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Waiting patiently on the Lord, for your prayers have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded with this seal and testament—the Lord hath sworn and decreed that they shall be granted.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Therefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant that they shall be fulfilled; and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name’s glory, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And now, verily I say unto you concerning the laws of the land, it is my will that my people should observe to do all things whatsoever I command them.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than this, cometh of evil.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and the law also maketh you free.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; otherwise whatsoever is less than these cometh of evil.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall forsake all evil and cleave unto all good, that ye shall live by every word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and prove you herewith.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name’s sake, shall find it again, even life eternal.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Therefore, be not afraid of your enemies, for I have decreed in my heart, saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>For if ye will not abide in my covenant ye are not worthy of me.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Therefore, renounce war and proclaim peace, and seek diligently to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers, and the hearts of the fathers to the children;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And again, the hearts of the Jews unto the prophets, and the prophets unto the Jews; lest I come and smite the whole earth with a curse, and all flesh be consumed before me.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Let not your hearts be troubled; for in my Father’s house are many mansions, and I have prepared a place for you; and where my Father and I am, there ye shall be also.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Behold, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with many who are in the church at Kirtland;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>For they do not forsake their sins, and their wicked ways, the pride of their hearts, and their covetousness, and all their detestable things, and observe the words of wisdom and eternal life which I have given unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will chasten them and will do whatsoever I list, if they do not repent and observe all things whatsoever I have said unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And again I say unto you, if ye observe to do whatsoever I command you, I, the Lord, will turn away all wrath and indignation from you, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Now, I speak unto you concerning your families—if men will smite you, or your families, once, and ye bear it patiently and revile not against them, neither seek revenge, ye shall be rewarded;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>But if ye bear it not patiently, it shall be accounted unto you as being meted out as a just measure unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And again, if your enemy shall smite you the second time, and you revile not against your enemy, and bear it patiently, your reward shall be an hundred-fold.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And again, if he shall smite you the third time, and ye bear it patiently, your reward shall be doubled unto you four-fold;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And these three testimonies shall stand against your enemy if he repent not, and shall not be blotted out.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, if that enemy shall escape my vengeance, that he be not brought into judgment before me, then ye shall see to it that ye warn him in my name, that he come no more upon you, neither upon your family, even your children’s children unto the third and fourth generation.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And then, if he shall come upon you or your children, or your children’s children unto the third and fourth generation, I have delivered thine enemy into thine hands;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And then if thou wilt spare him, thou shalt be rewarded for thy righteousness; and also thy children and thy children’s children unto the third and fourth generation.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Nevertheless, thine enemy is in thine hands; and if thou rewardest him according to his works thou art justified; if he has sought thy life, and thy life is endangered by him, thine enemy is in thine hands and thou art justified.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Behold, this is the law I gave unto my servant Nephi, and thy fathers, Joseph, and Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham, and all mine ancient prophets and apostles.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And again, this is the law that I gave unto mine ancients, that they should not go out unto battle against any nation, kindred, tongue, or people, save I, the Lord, commanded them.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And if any nation, tongue, or people should proclaim war against them, they should first lift a standard of peace unto that people, nation, or tongue;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And if that people did not accept the offering of peace, neither the second nor the third time, they should bring these testimonies before the Lord;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Then I, the Lord, would give unto them a commandment, and justify them in going out to battle against that nation, tongue, or people.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And I, the Lord, would fight their battles, and their children’s battles, and their children’s children’s, until they had avenged themselves on all their enemies, to the third and fourth generation.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Behold, this is an ensample unto all people, saith the Lord your God, for justification before me.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, if after thine enemy has come upon thee the first time, he repent and come unto thee praying thy forgiveness, thou shalt forgive him, and shalt hold it no more as a testimony against thine enemy—</p>
    <p id="section-98_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And so on unto the second and third time; and as oft as thine enemy repenteth of the trespass wherewith he has trespassed against thee, thou shalt forgive him, until seventy times seven.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And if he trespass against thee and repent not the first time, nevertheless thou shalt forgive him.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And if he trespass against thee the second time, and repent not, nevertheless thou shalt forgive him.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And if he trespass against thee the third time, and repent not, thou shalt also forgive him.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>But if he trespass against thee the fourth time thou shalt not forgive him, but shalt bring these testimonies before the Lord; and they shall not be blotted out until he repent and reward thee four-fold in all things wherewith he has trespassed against thee.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>And if he do this, thou shalt forgive him with all thine heart; and if he do not this, I, the Lord, will avenge thee of thine enemy an hundred-fold;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And upon his children, and upon his children’s children of all them that hate me, unto the third and fourth generation.</p>
    <p id="section-98_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>But if the children shall repent, or the children’s children, and turn to the Lord their God, with all their hearts and with all their might, mind, and strength, and restore four-fold for all their trespasses wherewith they have trespassed, or wherewith their fathers have trespassed, or their fathers’ fathers, then thine indignation shall be turned away;</p>
    <p id="section-98_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And vengeance shall no more come upon them, saith the Lord thy God, and their trespasses shall never be brought any more as a testimony before the Lord against them. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-101" class="chapter-title">Section 101</h2>
    <p id="section-101_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily I say unto you, concerning your brethren who have been afflicted, and persecuted, and cast out from the land of their inheritance—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>I, the Lord, have suffered the affliction to come upon them, wherewith they have been afflicted, in consequence of their transgressions;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Yet I will own them, and they shall be mine in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Therefore, they must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Behold, I say unto you, there were jarrings, and contentions, and envyings, and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Verily I say unto you, notwithstanding their sins, my bowels are filled with compassion towards them. I will not utterly cast them off; and in the day of wrath I will remember mercy.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>I have sworn, and the decree hath gone forth by a former commandment which I have given unto you, that I would let fall the sword of mine indignation in behalf of my people; and even as I have said, it shall come to pass.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Mine indignation is soon to be poured out without measure upon all nations; and this will I do when the cup of their iniquity is full.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And in that day all who are found upon the watch-tower, or in other words, all mine Israel, shall be saved.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And they that have been scattered shall be gathered.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And all they who have mourned shall be comforted.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And all they who have given their lives for my name shall be crowned.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Zion shall not be moved out of her place, notwithstanding her children are scattered.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>They that remain, and are pure in heart, shall return, and come to their inheritances, they and their children, with songs of everlasting joy, to build up the waste places of Zion—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And all these things that the prophets might be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And, behold, there is none other place appointed than that which I have appointed; neither shall there be any other place appointed than that which I have appointed, for the work of the gathering of my saints—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Until the day cometh when there is found no more room for them; and then I have other places which I will appoint unto them, and they shall be called stakes, for the curtains or the strength of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Behold, it is my will, that all they who call on my name, and worship me according to mine everlasting gospel, should gather together, and stand in holy places;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And prepare for the revelation which is to come, when the veil of the covering of my temple, in my tabernacle, which hideth the earth, shall be taken off, and all flesh shall see me together.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And every corruptible thing, both of man, or of the beasts of the field, or of the fowls of the heavens, or of the fish of the sea, that dwells upon all the face of the earth, shall be consumed;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And also that of element shall melt with fervent heat; and all things shall become new, that my knowledge and glory may dwell upon all the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And in that day the enmity of man, and the enmity of beasts, yea, the enmity of all flesh, shall cease from before my face.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And in that day whatsoever any man shall ask, it shall be given unto him.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And in that day Satan shall not have power to tempt any man.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And there shall be no sorrow because there is no death.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>In that day an infant shall not die until he is old; and his life shall be as the age of a tree;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And when he dies he shall not sleep, that is to say in the earth, but shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and shall be caught up, and his rest shall be glorious.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Yea, verily I say unto you, in that day when the Lord shall come, he shall reveal all things—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Things which have passed, and hidden things which no man knew, things of the earth, by which it was made, and the purpose and the end thereof—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Things most precious, things that are above, and things that are beneath, things that are in the earth, and upon the earth, and in heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And all they who suffer persecution for my name, and endure in faith, though they are called to lay down their lives for my sake yet shall they partake of all this glory.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Wherefore, fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy is full.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>Therefore, care not for the body, neither the life of the body; but care for the soul, and for the life of the soul.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess your souls, and ye shall have eternal life.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>When men are called unto mine everlasting gospel, and covenant with an everlasting covenant, they are accounted as the salt of the earth and the savor of men;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>They are called to be the savor of men; therefore, if that salt of the earth lose its savor, behold, it is thenceforth good for nothing only to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Behold, here is wisdom concerning the children of Zion, even many, but not all; they were found transgressors, therefore they must needs be chastened—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>He that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that abaseth himself shall be exalted.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And now, I will show unto you a parable, that you may know my will concerning the redemption of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>A certain nobleman had a spot of land, very choice; and he said unto his servants: Go ye unto my vineyard, even upon this very choice piece of land, and plant twelve olive trees;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>And set watchmen round about them, and build a tower, that one may overlook the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall come to spoil and take upon themselves the fruit of my vineyard.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Now, the servants of the nobleman went and did as their lord commanded them, and planted the olive trees, and built a hedge round about, and set watchmen, and began to build a tower.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And while they were yet laying the foundation thereof, they began to say among themselves: And what need hath my lord of this tower?</p>
    <p id="section-101_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And consulted for a long time, saying among themselves: What need hath my lord of this tower, seeing this is a time of peace?</p>
    <p id="section-101_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>Might not this money be given to the exchangers? For there is no need of these things.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And while they were at variance one with another they became very slothful, and they hearkened not unto the commandments of their lord.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And the enemy came by night, and broke down the hedge; and the servants of the nobleman arose and were affrighted, and fled; and the enemy destroyed their works, and broke down the olive trees.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>Now, behold, the nobleman, the lord of the vineyard, called upon his servants, and said unto them, Why! what is the cause of this great evil?</p>
    <p id="section-101_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you, and—after ye had planted the vineyard, and built the hedge round about, and set watchmen upon the walls thereof—built the tower also, and set a watchman upon the tower, and watched for my vineyard, and not have fallen asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you?</p>
    <p id="section-101_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And behold, the watchman upon the tower would have seen the enemy while he was yet afar off; and then ye could have made ready and kept the enemy from breaking down the hedge thereof, and saved my vineyard from the hands of the destroyer.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And the lord of the vineyard said unto one of his servants: Go and gather together the residue of my servants, and take all the strength of mine house, which are my warriors, my young men, and they that are of middle age also among all my servants, who are the strength of mine house, save those only whom I have appointed to tarry;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And go ye straightway unto the land of my vineyard, and redeem my vineyard; for it is mine; I have bought it with money.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>Therefore, get ye straightway unto my land; break down the walls of mine enemies; throw down their tower, and scatter their watchmen.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>And inasmuch as they gather together against you, avenge me of mine enemies, that by and by I may come with the residue of mine house and possess the land.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>And the servant said unto his lord: When shall these things be?</p>
    <p id="section-101_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>And he said unto his servant: When I will; go ye straightway, and do all things whatsoever I have commanded you;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>And this shall be my seal and blessing upon you—a faithful and wise steward in the midst of mine house, a ruler in my kingdom.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>And his servant went straightway, and did all things whatsoever his lord commanded him; and after many days all things were fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>Again, verily I say unto you, I will show unto you wisdom in me concerning all the churches, inasmuch as they are willing to be guided in a right and proper way for their salvation—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>That the work of the gathering together of my saints may continue, that I may build them up unto my name upon holy places; for the time of harvest is come, and my word must needs be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>Therefore, I must gather together my people, according to the parable of the wheat and the tares, that the wheat may be secured in the garners to possess eternal life, and be crowned with celestial glory, when I shall come in the kingdom of my Father to reward every man according as his work shall be;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>While the tares shall be bound in bundles, and their bands made strong, that they may be burned with unquenchable fire.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>Therefore, a commandment I give unto all the churches, that they shall continue to gather together unto the places which I have appointed.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>Nevertheless, as I have said unto you in a former commandment, let not your gathering be in haste, nor by flight; but let all things be prepared before you.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v69" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69 </span>And in order that all things be prepared before you, observe the commandment which I have given concerning these things—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v70" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70 </span>Which saith, or teacheth, to purchase all the lands with money, which can be purchased for money, in the region round about the land which I have appointed to be the land of Zion, for the beginning of the gathering of my saints;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v71" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71 </span>All the land which can be purchased in Jackson county, and the counties round about, and leave the residue in mine hand.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v72" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72 </span>Now, verily I say unto you, let all the churches gather together all their moneys; let these things be done in their time, but not in haste; and observe to have all things prepared before you.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v73" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">73 </span>And let honorable men be appointed, even wise men, and send them to purchase these lands.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v74" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74 </span>And the churches in the eastern countries, when they are built up, if they will hearken unto this counsel they may buy lands and gather together upon them; and in this way they may establish Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v75" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">75 </span>There is even now already in store sufficient, yea, even an abundance, to redeem Zion, and establish her waste places, no more to be thrown down, were the churches, who call themselves after my name, willing to hearken to my voice.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v76" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">76 </span>And again I say unto you, those who have been scattered by their enemies, it is my will that they should continue to importune for redress, and redemption, by the hands of those who are placed as rulers and are in authority over you—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v77" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">77 </span>According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v78" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">78 </span>That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v79" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">79 </span>Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v80" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">80 </span>And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v81" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">81 </span>Now, unto what shall I liken the children of Zion? I will liken them unto the parable of the woman and the unjust judge, for men ought always to pray and not to faint, which saith—</p>
    <p id="section-101_v82" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">82 </span>There was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded man.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v83" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">83 </span>And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying: Avenge me of mine adversary.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v84" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">84 </span>And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself: Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v85" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">85 </span>Thus will I liken the children of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v86" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">86 </span>Let them importune at the feet of the judge;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v87" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">87 </span>And if he heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the governor;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v88" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">88 </span>And if the governor heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the president;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v89" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">89 </span>And if the president heed them not, then will the Lord arise and come forth out of his hiding place, and in his fury vex the nation;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v90" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">90 </span>And in his hot displeasure, and in his fierce anger, in his time, will cut off those wicked, unfaithful, and unjust stewards, and appoint them their portion among hypocrites, and unbelievers;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v91" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">91 </span>Even in outer darkness, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v92" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">92 </span>Pray ye, therefore, that their ears may be opened unto your cries, that I may be merciful unto them, that these things may not come upon them.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v93" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">93 </span>What I have said unto you must needs be, that all men may be left without excuse;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v94" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">94 </span>That wise men and rulers may hear and know that which they have never considered;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v95" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">95 </span>That I may proceed to bring to pass my act, my strange act, and perform my work, my strange work, that men may discern between the righteous and the wicked, saith your God.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v96" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">96 </span>And again, I say unto you, it is contrary to my commandment and my will that my servant Sidney Gilbert should sell my storehouse, which I have appointed unto my people, into the hands of mine enemies.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v97" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">97 </span>Let not that which I have appointed be polluted by mine enemies, by the consent of those who call themselves after my name;</p>
    <p id="section-101_v98" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">98 </span>For this is a very sore and grievous sin against me, and against my people, in consequence of those things which I have decreed and which are soon to befall the nations.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v99" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">99 </span>Therefore, it is my will that my people should claim, and hold claim upon that which I have appointed unto them, though they should not be permitted to dwell thereon.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v100" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">100 </span>Nevertheless, I do not say they shall not dwell thereon; for inasmuch as they bring forth fruit and works meet for my kingdom they shall dwell thereon.</p>
    <p id="section-101_v101" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">101 </span>They shall build, and another shall not inherit it; they shall plant vineyards, and they shall eat the fruit thereof. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-102" class="chapter-title">Section 102</h2>
    <p id="section-102_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>This day a general council of twenty-four high priests assembled at the house of Joseph Smith, Jun., by revelation, and proceeded to organize the high council of the church of Christ, which was to consist of twelve high priests, and one or three presidents as the case might require.</p>
    <p id="section-102_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>The high council was appointed by revelation for the purpose of settling important difficulties which might arise in the church, which could not be settled by the church or the bishop’s council to the satisfaction of the parties.</p>
    <p id="section-102_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Joseph Smith, Jun., Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G.

Smith, Orson Hyde, Sylvester Smith, and Luke Johnson, high priests, were chosen to be a standing council for the church, by the unanimous voice of the council.</p>
    <p id="section-102_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>The above-named councilors were then asked whether they accepted their appointments, and whether they would act in that office according to the law of heaven, to which they all answered that they accepted their appointments, and would fill their offices according to the grace of God bestowed upon them.</p>
    <p id="section-102_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>The number composing the council, who voted in the name and for the church in appointing the above-named councilors were forty-three, as follows: nine high priests, seventeen elders, four priests, and thirteen members.</p>

    <p id="section-102_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>The president of the church, who is also the president of the council, is appointed by revelation, and acknowledged in his administration by the voice of the church.</p>

    <p id="section-102_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Whenever a high council of the church of Christ is regularly organized, according to the foregoing pattern, it shall be the duty of the twelve councilors to cast lots by numbers, and thereby ascertain who of the twelve shall speak first, commencing with number one and so in succession to number twelve.</p>
    <p id="section-102_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Whenever this council convenes to act upon any case, the twelve councilors shall consider whether it is a difficult one or not; if it is not, two only of the councilors shall speak upon it, according to the form above written.</p>
    <p id="section-102_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But if it is thought to be difficult, four shall be appointed; and if more difficult, six; but in no case shall more than six be appointed to speak.</p>
    <p id="section-102_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>The accused, in all cases, has a right to one-half of the council, to prevent insult or injustice.</p>
    <p id="section-102_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And the councilors appointed to speak before the council are to present the case, after the evidence is examined, in its true light before the council; and every man is to speak according to equity and justice.</p>

    <p id="section-102_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>This council of high priests abroad is only to be called on the most difficult cases of church matters; and no common or ordinary case is to be sufficient to call such council.</p>

    <h2 id="section-103" class="chapter-title">Section 103</h2>
    <p id="section-103_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily I say unto you, my friends, behold, I will give unto you a revelation and commandment, that you may know how to act in the discharge of your duties concerning the salvation and redemption of your brethren, who have been scattered on the land of Zion;</p>
    <p id="section-103_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Being driven and smitten by the hands of mine enemies, on whom I will pour out my wrath without measure in mine own time.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>For I have suffered them thus far, that they might fill up the measure of their iniquities, that their cup might be full;</p>
    <p id="section-103_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And that those who call themselves after my name might be chastened for a little season with a sore and grievous chastisement, because they did not hearken altogether unto the precepts and commandments which I gave unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>But verily I say unto you, that I have decreed a decree which my people shall realize, inasmuch as they hearken from this very hour unto the counsel which I, the Lord their God, shall give unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Behold they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail against mine enemies from this very hour.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And by hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord their God, shall speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the saints, to possess it forever and ever.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But inasmuch as they keep not my commandments, and hearken not to observe all my words, the kingdoms of the world shall prevail against them.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>For they were set to be a light unto the world, and to be the saviors of men;</p>
    <p id="section-103_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And inasmuch as they are not the saviors of men, they are as salt that has lost its savor, and is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>But verily I say unto you, I have decreed that your brethren which have been scattered shall return to the lands of their inheritances, and shall build up the waste places of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>For after much tribulation, as I have said unto you in a former commandment, cometh the blessing.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Behold, this is the blessing which I have promised after your tribulations, and the tribulations of your brethren—your redemption, and the redemption of your brethren, even their restoration to the land of Zion, to be established, no more to be thrown down.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Nevertheless, if they pollute their inheritances they shall be thrown down; for I will not spare them if they pollute their inheritances.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Behold, I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must needs come by power;</p>
    <p id="section-103_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead them like as Moses led the children of Israel.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For ye are the children of Israel, and of the seed of Abraham, and ye must needs be led out of bondage by power, and with a stretched-out arm.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And as your fathers were led at the first, even so shall the redemption of Zion be.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Therefore, let not your hearts faint, for I say not unto you as I said unto your fathers: Mine angel shall go up before you, but not my presence.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But I say unto you: Mine angels shall go up before you, and also my presence, and in time ye shall possess the goodly land.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Verily, verily I say unto you, that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., is the man to whom I likened the servant to whom the Lord of the vineyard spake in the parable which I have given unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Therefore let my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., say unto the strength of my house, my young men and the middle aged—Gather yourselves together unto the land of Zion, upon the land which I have bought with money that has been consecrated unto me.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And let all the churches send up wise men with their moneys, and purchase lands even as I have commanded them.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And inasmuch as mine enemies come against you to drive you from my goodly land, which I have consecrated to be the land of Zion, even from your own lands after these testimonies, which ye have brought before me against them, ye shall curse them;</p>
    <p id="section-103_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And whomsoever ye curse, I will curse, and ye shall avenge me of mine enemies.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And my presence shall be with you even in avenging me of mine enemies, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Let no man be afraid to lay down his life for my sake; for whoso layeth down his life for my sake shall find it again.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And whoso is not willing to lay down his life for my sake is not my disciple.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>It is my will that my servant Sidney Rigdon shall lift up his voice in the congregations in the eastern countries, in preparing the churches to keep the commandments which I have given unto them concerning the restoration and redemption of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>It is my will that my servant Parley P. Pratt and my servant Lyman Wight should not return to the land of their brethren, until they have obtained companies to go up unto the land of Zion, by tens, or by twenties, or by fifties, or by an hundred, until they have obtained to the number of five hundred of the strength of my house.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Behold this is my will; ask and ye shall receive; but men do not always do my will.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Therefore, if you cannot obtain five hundred, seek diligently that peradventure you may obtain three hundred.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And if ye cannot obtain three hundred, seek diligently that peradventure ye may obtain one hundred.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>But verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall not go up unto the land of Zion until you have obtained a hundred of the strength of my house, to go up with you unto the land of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Therefore, as I said unto you, ask and ye shall receive; pray earnestly that peradventure my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may go with you, and preside in the midst of my people, and organize my kingdom upon the consecrated land, and establish the children of Zion upon the laws and commandments which have been and which shall be given unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>All victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your diligence, faithfulness, and prayers of faith.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>Let my servant Parley P. Pratt journey with my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Let my servant Lyman Wight journey with my servant Sidney Rigdon.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Let my servant Hyrum Smith journey with my servant Frederick G. Williams.</p>
    <p id="section-103_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>Let my servant Orson Hyde journey with my servant Orson Pratt, whithersoever my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., shall counsel them, in obtaining the fulfilment of these commandments which I have given unto you, and leave the residue in my hands. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="section-104" class="chapter-title">Section 104</h2>
    <p id="section-104_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily I say unto you, my friends, I give unto you counsel, and a commandment, concerning all the properties which belong to the order which I commanded to be organized and established, to be a united order, and an everlasting order for the benefit of my church, and for the salvation of men until I come—</p>
    <p id="section-104_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>With promise immutable and unchangeable, that inasmuch as those whom I commanded were faithful they should be blessed with a multiplicity of blessings;</p>
    <p id="section-104_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>But inasmuch as they were not faithful they were nigh unto cursing.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Therefore, inasmuch as some of my servants have not kept the commandment, but have broken the covenant through covetousness, and with feigned words, I have cursed them with a very sore and grievous curse.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>For I, the Lord, have decreed in my heart, that inasmuch as any man belonging to the order shall be found a transgressor, or, in other words, shall break the covenant with which ye are bound, he shall be cursed in his life, and shall be trodden down by whom I will;</p>
    <p id="section-104_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in these things—</p>
    <p id="section-104_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And all this that the innocent among you may not be condemned with the unjust; and that the guilty among you may not escape; because I, the Lord, have promised unto you a crown of glory at my right hand.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Therefore, inasmuch as you are found transgressors, you cannot escape my wrath in your lives.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Inasmuch as ye are cut off for transgression, ye cannot escape the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And I now give unto you power from this very hour, that if any man among you, of the order, is found a transgressor and repenteth not of the evil, that ye shall deliver him over unto the buffetings of Satan; and he shall not have power to bring evil upon you.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>It is wisdom in me; therefore, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man his stewardship;</p>
    <p id="section-104_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>That every man may give an account unto me of the stewardship which is appointed unto him.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable, as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my creatures.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, concerning the properties of the order—</p>
    <p id="section-104_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Let my servant Sidney Rigdon have appointed unto him the place where he now resides, and the lot of the tannery for his stewardship, for his support while he is laboring in my vineyard, even as I will, when I shall command him.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And let all things be done according to the counsel of the order, and united consent or voice of the order, which dwell in the land of Kirtland.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And this stewardship and blessing, I, the Lord, confer upon my servant Sidney Rigdon for a blessing upon him, and his seed after him;</p>
    <p id="section-104_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And I will multiply blessings upon him, inasmuch as he will be humble before me.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And again, let my servant Martin Harris have appointed unto him, for his stewardship, the lot of land which my servant John Johnson obtained in exchange for his former inheritance, for him and his seed after him;</p>
    <p id="section-104_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply blessings upon him and his seed after him.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And let my servant Martin Harris devote his moneys for the proclaiming of my words, according as my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., shall direct.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And again, let my servant Frederick G. Williams have the place upon which he now dwells.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And let my servant Oliver Cowdery have the lot which is set off joining the house, which is to be for the printing office, which is lot number one, and also the lot upon which his father resides.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And let my servants Frederick G. Williams and Oliver Cowdery have the printing office and all things that pertain unto it.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And this shall be their stewardship which shall be appointed unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And inasmuch as they are faithful, behold I will bless, and multiply blessings upon them.</p>

    <p id="section-104_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And, inasmuch as they are faithful, I will multiply blessings upon them and their seed after them, even a multiplicity of blessings.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And again, let my servant John Johnson have the house in which he lives, and the inheritance, all save the ground which has been reserved for the building of my houses, which pertains to that inheritance, and those lots which have been named for my servant Oliver Cowdery.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply blessings upon him.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And it is my will that he should sell the lots that are laid off for the building up of the city of my saints, inasmuch as it shall be made known to him by the voice of the Spirit, and according to the counsel of the order, and by the voice of the order.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And this is the beginning of the stewardship which I have appointed unto him, for a blessing unto him and his seed after him.</p>

    <p id="section-104_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And again, let my servant Newel K.

    <p id="section-104_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And again, let my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., have appointed unto him the lot which is laid off for the building of my house, which is forty rods long and twelve wide, and also the inheritance upon which his father now resides;</p>

    <p id="section-104_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>After you are organized, you shall be called the United Order of the Stake of Zion, the City of Kirtland. And your brethren, after they are organized, shall be called the United Order of the City of Zion.</p>

    <p id="section-104_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And this I have commanded to be done for your salvation, and also for their salvation, in consequence of their being driven out and that which is to come.</p>

    <p id="section-104_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And again, a commandment I give unto you concerning your stewardship which I have appointed unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>Behold, all these properties are mine, or else your faith is vain, and ye are found hypocrites, and the covenants which ye have made unto me are broken;</p>
    <p id="section-104_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And if the properties are mine, then ye are stewards; otherwise ye are no stewards.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>But, verily I say unto you, I have appointed unto you to be stewards over mine house, even stewards indeed.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>And for this purpose I have commanded you to organize yourselves, even to print my words, the fulness of my scriptures, the revelations which I have given unto you, and which I shall, hereafter, from time to time give unto you—</p>
    <p id="section-104_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>For the purpose of building up my church and kingdom on the earth, and to prepare my people for the time when I shall dwell with them, which is nigh at hand.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>And ye shall prepare for yourselves a place for a treasury, and consecrate it unto my name.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>And ye shall appoint one among you to keep the treasury, and he shall be ordained unto this blessing.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>And there shall be a seal upon the treasury, and all the sacred things shall be delivered into the treasury; and no man among you shall call it his own, or any part of it, for it shall belong to you all with one accord.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>And I give it unto you from this very hour; and now see to it, that ye go to and make use of the stewardship which I have appointed unto you, exclusive of the sacred things, for the purpose of printing these sacred things as I have said.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>And the avails of the sacred things shall be had in the treasury, and a seal shall be upon it; and it shall not be used or taken out of the treasury by any one, neither shall the seal be loosed which shall be placed upon it, only by the voice of the order, or by commandment.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>And thus shall ye preserve the avails of the sacred things in the treasury, for sacred and holy purposes.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>And this shall be called the sacred treasury of the Lord; and a seal shall be kept upon it that it may be holy and consecrated unto the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>And again, there shall be another treasury prepared, and a treasurer appointed to keep the treasury, and a seal shall be placed upon it;</p>
    <p id="section-104_v68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>And all moneys that you receive in your stewardships, by improving upon the properties which I have appointed unto you, in houses, or in lands, or in cattle, or in all things save it be the holy and sacred writings, which I have reserved unto myself for holy and sacred purposes, shall be cast into the treasury as fast as you receive moneys, by hundreds, or by fifties, or by twenties, or by tens, or by fives.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v69" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69 </span>Or in other words, if any man among you obtain five dollars let him cast them into the treasury; or if he obtain ten, or twenty, or fifty, or an hundred, let him do likewise;</p>
    <p id="section-104_v70" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70 </span>And let not any among you say that it is his own; for it shall not be called his, nor any part of it.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v71" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71 </span>And there shall not any part of it be used, or taken out of the treasury, only by the voice and common consent of the order.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v72" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72 </span>And this shall be the voice and common consent of the order—that any man among you say to the treasurer: I have need of this to help me in my stewardship—</p>
    <p id="section-104_v73" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">73 </span>If it be five dollars, or if it be ten dollars, or twenty, or fifty, or a hundred, the treasurer shall give unto him the sum which he requires to help him in his stewardship—</p>
    <p id="section-104_v74" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74 </span>Until he be found a transgressor, and it is manifest before the council of the order plainly that he is an unfaithful and an unwise steward.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v75" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">75 </span>But so long as he is in full fellowship, and is faithful and wise in his stewardship, this shall be his token unto the treasurer that the treasurer shall not withhold.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v76" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">76 </span>But in case of transgression, the treasurer shall be subject unto the council and voice of the order.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v77" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">77 </span>And in case the treasurer is found an unfaithful and an unwise steward, he shall be subject to the council and voice of the order, and shall be removed out of his place, and another shall be appointed in his stead.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v78" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">78 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, concerning your debts—behold it is my will that you shall pay all your debts.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v79" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">79 </span>And it is my will that you shall humble yourselves before me, and obtain this blessing by your diligence and humility and the prayer of faith.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v80" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">80 </span>And inasmuch as you are diligent and humble, and exercise the prayer of faith, behold, I will soften the hearts of those to whom you are in debt, until I shall send means unto you for your deliverance.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v81" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">81 </span>Therefore write speedily to New York and write according to that which shall be dictated by my Spirit; and I will soften the hearts of those to whom you are in debt, that it shall be taken away out of their minds to bring affliction upon you.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v82" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">82 </span>And inasmuch as ye are humble and faithful and call upon my name, behold, I will give you the victory.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v83" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">83 </span>I give unto you a promise, that you shall be delivered this once out of your bondage.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v84" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">84 </span>Inasmuch as you obtain a chance to loan money by hundreds, or thousands, even until you shall loan enough to deliver yourself from bondage, it is your privilege.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v85" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">85 </span>And pledge the properties which I have put into your hands, this once, by giving your names by common consent or otherwise, as it shall seem good unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-104_v86" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">86 </span>I give unto you this privilege, this once; and behold, if you proceed to do the things which I have laid before you, according to my commandments, all these things are mine, and ye are my stewards, and the master will not suffer his house to be broken up.

    <h2 id="section-105" class="chapter-title">Section 105</h2>
    <p id="section-105_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that you may learn my will concerning the redemption of mine afflicted people—</p>
    <p id="section-105_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Behold, I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my people, speaking concerning the church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed even now.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I required at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil, and do not impart of their substance, as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted among them;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And are not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of the celestial kingdom; otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>I speak not concerning those who are appointed to lead my people, who are the first elders of my church, for they are not all under this condemnation;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But I speak concerning my churches abroad—there are many who will say: Where is their God? Behold, he will deliver them in time of trouble, otherwise we will not go up unto Zion, and will keep our moneys.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Therefore, in consequence of the transgressions of my people, it is expedient in me that mine elders should wait for a little season for the redemption of Zion—</p>
    <p id="section-105_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>That they themselves may be prepared, and that my people may be taught more perfectly, and have experience, and know more perfectly concerning their duty, and the things which I require at their hands.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And this cannot be brought to pass until mine elders are endowed with power from on high.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>For behold, I have prepared a great endowment and blessing to be poured out upon them, inasmuch as they are faithful and continue in humility before me.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Therefore it is expedient in me that mine elders should wait for a little season, for the redemption of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>For behold, I do not require at their hands to fight the battles of Zion; for, as I said in a former commandment, even so will I fulfil—I will fight your battles.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Behold, the destroyer I have sent forth to destroy and lay waste mine enemies; and not many years hence they shall not be left to pollute mine heritage, and to blaspheme my name upon the lands which I have consecrated for the gathering together of my saints.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Behold, I have commanded my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to say unto the strength of my house, even my warriors, my young men, and middle-aged, to gather together for the redemption of my people, and throw down the towers of mine enemies, and scatter their watchmen;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>But the strength of mine house have not hearkened unto my words.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>But inasmuch as there are those who have hearkened unto my words, I have prepared a blessing and an endowment for them, if they continue faithful.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>I have heard their prayers, and will accept their offering; and it is expedient in me that they should be brought thus far for a trial of their faith.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And now, verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto you, that as many as have come up hither, that can stay in the region round about, let them stay;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And those that cannot stay, who have families in the east, let them tarry for a little season, inasmuch as my servant Joseph shall appoint unto them;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>For I will counsel him concerning this matter, and all things whatsoever he shall appoint unto them shall be fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And let all my people who dwell in the regions round about be very faithful, and prayerful, and humble before me, and reveal not the things which I have revealed unto them, until it is wisdom in me that they should be revealed.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Talk not of judgments, neither boast of faith nor of mighty works, but carefully gather together, as much in one region as can be, consistently with the feelings of the people;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And behold, I will give unto you favor and grace in their eyes, that you may rest in peace and safety, while you are saying unto the people: Execute judgment and justice for us according to law, and redress us of our wrongs.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Now, behold, I say unto you, my friends, in this way you may find favor in the eyes of the people, until the army of Israel becomes very great.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And I will soften the hearts of the people, as I did the heart of Pharaoh, from time to time, until my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and mine elders, whom I have appointed, shall have time to gather up the strength of my house,</p>
    <p id="section-105_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And to have sent wise men, to fulfil that which I have commanded concerning the purchasing of all the lands in Jackson county that can be purchased, and in the adjoining counties round about.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>For it is my will that these lands should be purchased; and after they are purchased that my saints should possess them according to the laws of consecration which I have given.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And after these lands are purchased, I will hold the armies of Israel guiltless in taking possession of their own lands, which they have previously purchased with their moneys, and of throwing down the towers of mine enemies that may be upon them, and scattering their watchmen, and avenging me of mine enemies unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>But first let my army become very great, and let it be sanctified before me, that it may become fair as the sun, and clear as the moon, and that her banners may be terrible unto all nations;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>That the kingdoms of this world may be constrained to acknowledge that the kingdom of Zion is in very deed the kingdom of our God and his Christ; therefore, let us become subject unto her laws.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Verily I say unto you, it is expedient in me that the first elders of my church should receive their endowment from on high in my house, which I have commanded to be built unto my name in the land of Kirtland.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And let those commandments which I have given concerning Zion and her law be executed and fulfilled, after her redemption.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>There has been a day of calling, but the time has come for a day of choosing; and let those be chosen that are worthy.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And it shall be manifest unto my servant, by the voice of the Spirit, those that are chosen; and they shall be sanctified;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And inasmuch as they follow the counsel which they receive, they shall have power after many days to accomplish all things pertaining to Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And again I say unto you, sue for peace, not only to the people that have smitten you, but also to all people;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And lift up an ensign of peace, and make a proclamation of peace unto the ends of the earth;</p>
    <p id="section-105_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And make proposals for peace unto those who have smitten you, according to the voice of the Spirit which is in you, and all things shall work together for your good.</p>
    <p id="section-105_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Therefore, be faithful; and behold, and lo, I am with you even unto the end. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-106_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>It is my will that my servant Warren A. Cowdery should be appointed and ordained a presiding high priest over my church, in the land of Freedom and the regions round about;</p>
    <p id="section-106_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And should preach my everlasting gospel, and lift up his voice and warn the people, not only in his own place, but in the adjoining counties;</p>
    <p id="section-106_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And devote his whole time to this high and holy calling, which I now give unto him, seeking diligently the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, and all things necessary shall be added thereunto; for the laborer is worthy of his hire.</p>
    <p id="section-106_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and it overtaketh the world as a thief in the night—</p>

    <h2 id="section-107" class="chapter-title">Section 107</h2>
    <p id="section-107_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>There are, in the church, two priesthoods, namely, the Melchizedek and Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because Melchizedek was such a great high priest.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Before his day it was called <em>the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God.</em></p>
    <p id="section-107_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>All other authorities or offices in the church are appendages to this priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>But there are two divisions or grand heads—one is the Melchizedek Priesthood, and the other is the Aaronic or Levitical Priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>The office of an elder comes under the priesthood of Melchizedek.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>The Melchizedek Priesthood holds the right of presidency, and has power and authority over all the offices in the church in all ages of the world, to administer in spiritual things.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>The Presidency of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchizedek, have a right to officiate in all the offices in the church.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>High priests after the order of the Melchizedek Priesthood have a right to officiate in their own standing, under the direction of the presidency, in administering spiritual things, and also in the office of an elder, priest (of the Levitical order), teacher, deacon, and member.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>An elder has a right to officiate in his stead when the high priest is not present.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>The high priest and elder are to administer in spiritual things, agreeable to the covenants and commandments of the church; and they have a right to officiate in all these offices of the church when there are no higher authorities present.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>The second priesthood is called the Priesthood of Aaron, because it was conferred upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Why it is called the lesser priesthood is because it is an appendage to the greater, or the Melchizedek Priesthood, and has power in administering outward ordinances.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>The bishopric is the presidency of this priesthood, and holds the keys or authority of the same.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>No man has a legal right to this office, to hold the keys of this priesthood, except he be a literal descendant of Aaron.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>But as a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices, he may officiate in the office of bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power by the hands of the Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>The power and authority of the higher, or Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church—</p>
    <p id="section-107_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>To have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, to have the heavens opened unto them, to commune with the general assembly and church of the Firstborn, and to enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>The power and authority of the lesser, or Aaronic Priesthood, is to hold the keys of the ministering of angels, and to administer in outward ordinances, the letter of the gospel, the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, agreeable to the covenants and commandments.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Of necessity there are presidents, or presiding officers growing out of, or appointed of or from among those who are ordained to the several offices in these two priesthoods.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Of the Melchizedek Priesthood, three Presiding High Priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by the confidence, faith, and prayer of the church, form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>The twelve traveling councilors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world—thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And they form a quorum, equal in authority and power to the three presidents previously mentioned.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>The Seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world—thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And they form a quorum, equal in authority to that of the Twelve special witnesses or Apostles just named.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same; that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decisions, in order to make their decisions of the same power or validity one with the other—</p>
    <p id="section-107_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>A majority may form a quorum when circumstances render it impossible to be otherwise—</p>
    <p id="section-107_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Unless this is the case, their decisions are not entitled to the same blessings which the decisions of a quorum of three presidents were anciently, who were ordained after the order of Melchizedek, and were righteous and holy men.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>The decisions of these quorums, or either of them, are to be made in all righteousness, in holiness, and lowliness of heart, meekness and long-suffering, and in faith, and virtue, and knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and charity;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Because the promise is, if these things abound in them they shall not be unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And in case that any decision of these quorums is made in unrighteousness, it may be brought before a general assembly of the several quorums, which constitute the spiritual authorities of the church; otherwise there can be no appeal from their decision.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven; to build up the church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and secondly unto the Jews.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Twelve or the traveling high council, in building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews—</p>
    <p id="section-107_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>The Twelve being sent out, holding the keys, to open the door by the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and first unto the Gentiles and then unto the Jews.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>The standing high councils, at the stakes of Zion, form a quorum equal in authority in the affairs of the church, in all their decisions, to the quorum of the presidency, or to the traveling high council.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>The high council in Zion form a quorum equal in authority in the affairs of the church, in all their decisions, to the councils of the Twelve at the stakes of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>It is the duty of the traveling high council to call upon the Seventy, when they need assistance, to fill the several calls for preaching and administering the gospel, instead of any others.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>It is the duty of the Twelve, in all large branches of the church, to ordain evangelical ministers, as they shall be designated unto them by revelation—</p>
    <p id="section-107_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>The order of this priesthood was confirmed to be handed down from father to son, and rightly belongs to the literal descendants of the chosen seed, to whom the promises were made.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>This order was instituted in the days of Adam, and came down by lineage in the following manner:</p>
    <p id="section-107_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>From Adam to Seth, who was ordained by Adam at the age of sixty-nine years, and was blessed by him three years previous to his (Adam’s) death, and received the promise of God by his father, that his posterity should be the chosen of the Lord, and that they should be preserved unto the end of the earth;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>Because he (Seth) was a perfect man, and his likeness was the express likeness of his father, insomuch that he seemed to be like unto his father in all things, and could be distinguished from him only by his age.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>Enos was ordained at the age of one hundred and thirty-four years and four months, by the hand of Adam.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>God called upon Cainan in the wilderness in the fortieth year of his age; and he met Adam in journeying to the place Shedolamak. He was eighty-seven years old when he received his ordination.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Mahalaleel was four hundred and ninety-six years and seven days old when he was ordained by the hand of Adam, who also blessed him.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Jared was two hundred years old when he was ordained under the hand of Adam, who also blessed him.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>Enoch was twenty-five years old when he was ordained under the hand of Adam; and he was sixty-five and Adam blessed him.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>And he saw the Lord, and he walked with him, and was before his face continually; and he walked with God three hundred and sixty-five years, making him four hundred and thirty years old when he was translated.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>Methuselah was one hundred years old when he was ordained under the hand of Adam.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>Lamech was thirty-two years old when he was ordained under the hand of Seth.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>Noah was ten years old when he was ordained under the hand of Methuselah.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, with the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there bestowed upon them his last blessing.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And the Lord appeared unto them, and they rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the prince, the archangel.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And the Lord administered comfort unto Adam, and said unto him: I have set thee to be at the head; a multitude of nations shall come of thee, and thou art a prince over them forever.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And Adam stood up in the midst of the congregation; and, notwithstanding he was bowed down with age, being full of the Holy Ghost, predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>These things were all written in the book of Enoch, and are to be testified of in due time.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>It is the duty of the Twelve, also, to ordain and set in order all the other officers of the church, agreeable to the revelation which says:</p>
    <p id="section-107_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>To the church of Christ in the land of Zion, in addition to the church laws respecting church business—</p>
    <p id="section-107_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>Verily, I say unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts, there must needs be presiding elders to preside over those who are of the office of an elder;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>And also priests to preside over those who are of the office of a priest;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>And also teachers to preside over those who are of the office of a teacher, in like manner, and also the deacons—</p>
    <p id="section-107_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>Wherefore, from deacon to teacher, and from teacher to priest, and from priest to elder, severally as they are appointed, according to the covenants and commandments of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>Then comes the High Priesthood, which is the greatest of all.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>Wherefore, it must needs be that one be appointed of the High Priesthood to preside over the priesthood, and he shall be called President of the High Priesthood of the Church;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>Or, in other words, the Presiding High Priest over the High Priesthood of the Church.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>From the same comes the administering of ordinances and blessings upon the church, by the laying on of the hands.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>Wherefore, the office of a bishop is not equal unto it; for the office of a bishop is in administering all temporal things;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v69" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69 </span>Nevertheless a bishop must be chosen from the High Priesthood, unless he is a literal descendant of Aaron;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v70" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70 </span>For unless he is a literal descendant of Aaron he cannot hold the keys of that priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v71" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71 </span>Nevertheless, a high priest, that is, after the order of Melchizedek, may be set apart unto the ministering of temporal things, having a knowledge of them by the Spirit of truth;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v72" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72 </span>And also to be a judge in Israel, to do the business of the church, to sit in judgment upon transgressors upon testimony as it shall be laid before him according to the laws, by the assistance of his counselors, whom he has chosen or will choose among the elders of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v73" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">73 </span>This is the duty of a bishop who is not a literal descendant of Aaron, but has been ordained to the High Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v74" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74 </span>Thus shall he be a judge, even a common judge among the inhabitants of Zion, or in a stake of Zion, or in any branch of the church where he shall be set apart unto this ministry, until the borders of Zion are enlarged and it becomes necessary to have other bishops or judges in Zion or elsewhere.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v75" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">75 </span>And inasmuch as there are other bishops appointed they shall act in the same office.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v76" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">76 </span>But a literal descendant of Aaron has a legal right to the presidency of this priesthood, to the keys of this ministry, to act in the office of bishop independently, without counselors, except in a case where a President of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchizedek, is tried, to sit as a judge in Israel.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v77" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">77 </span>And the decision of either of these councils, agreeable to the commandment which says:</p>
    <p id="section-107_v78" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">78 </span>Again, verily, I say unto you, the most important business of the church, and the most difficult cases of the church, inasmuch as there is not satisfaction upon the decision of the bishop or judges, it shall be handed over and carried up unto the council of the church, before the Presidency of the High Priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v79" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">79 </span>And the Presidency of the council of the High Priesthood shall have power to call other high priests, even twelve, to assist as counselors; and thus the Presidency of the High Priesthood and its counselors shall have power to decide upon testimony according to the laws of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v80" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">80 </span>And after this decision it shall be had in remembrance no more before the Lord; for this is the highest council of the church of God, and a final decision upon controversies in spiritual matters.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v81" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">81 </span>There is not any person belonging to the church who is exempt from this council of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v82" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">82 </span>And inasmuch as a President of the High Priesthood shall transgress, he shall be had in remembrance before the common council of the church, who shall be assisted by twelve counselors of the High Priesthood;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v83" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">83 </span>And their decision upon his head shall be an end of controversy concerning him.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v84" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">84 </span>Thus, none shall be exempted from the justice and the laws of God, that all things may be done in order and in solemnity before him, according to truth and righteousness.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v85" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">85 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, the duty of a president over the office of a deacon is to preside over twelve deacons, to sit in council with them, and to teach them their duty, edifying one another, as it is given according to the covenants.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v86" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">86 </span>And also the duty of the president over the office of the teachers is to preside over twenty-four of the teachers, and to sit in council with them, teaching them the duties of their office, as given in the covenants.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v87" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">87 </span>Also the duty of the president over the Priesthood of Aaron is to preside over forty-eight priests, and sit in council with them, to teach them the duties of their office, as is given in the covenants—</p>
    <p id="section-107_v88" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">88 </span>This president is to be a bishop; for this is one of the duties of this priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v89" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">89 </span>Again, the duty of the president over the office of elders is to preside over ninety-six elders, and to sit in council with them, and to teach them according to the covenants.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v90" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">90 </span>This presidency is a distinct one from that of the seventy, and is designed for those who do not travel into all the world.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v91" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">91 </span>And again, the duty of the President of the office of the High Priesthood is to preside over the whole church, and to be like unto Moses—</p>
    <p id="section-107_v92" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">92 </span>Behold, here is wisdom; yea, to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the church.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v93" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">93 </span>And it is according to the vision showing the order of the Seventy, that they should have seven presidents to preside over them, chosen out of the number of the seventy;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v94" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">94 </span>And the seventh president of these presidents is to preside over the six;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v95" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">95 </span>And these seven presidents are to choose other seventy besides the first seventy to whom they belong, and are to preside over them;</p>
    <p id="section-107_v96" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">96 </span>And also other seventy, until seven times seventy, if the labor in the vineyard of necessity requires it.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v97" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">97 </span>And these seventy are to be traveling ministers, unto the Gentiles first and also unto the Jews.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v98" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">98 </span>Whereas other officers of the church, who belong not unto the Twelve, neither to the Seventy, are not under the responsibility to travel among all nations, but are to travel as their circumstances shall allow, notwithstanding they may hold as high and responsible offices in the church.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v99" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">99 </span>Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.</p>
    <p id="section-107_v100" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">100 </span>He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand. Even so. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-108_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Lyman: Your sins are forgiven you, because you have obeyed my voice in coming up hither this morning to receive counsel of him whom I have appointed.</p>

    <p id="section-109_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Thanks be to thy name, O Lord God of Israel, who keepest covenant and showest mercy unto thy servants who walk uprightly before thee, with all their hearts—</p>
    <p id="section-109_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Thou who hast commanded thy servants to build a house to thy name in this place [Kirtland].</p>
    <p id="section-109_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And now thou beholdest, O Lord, that thy servants have done according to thy commandment.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And now we ask thee, Holy Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of thy bosom, in whose name alone salvation can be administered to the children of men, we ask thee, O Lord, to accept of this house, the workmanship of the hands of us, thy servants, which thou didst command us to build.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>For thou knowest that we have done this work through great tribulation; and out of our poverty we have given of our substance to build a house to thy name, that the Son of Man might have a place to manifest himself to his people.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And as thou hast said in a revelation, given to us, calling us thy friends, saying—Call your solemn assembly, as I have commanded you;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing, and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>That your incomings may be in the name of the Lord, that your outgoings may be in the name of the Lord, that all your salutations may be in the name of the Lord, with uplifted hands unto the Most High—</p>
    <p id="section-109_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And now, Holy Father, we ask thee to assist us, thy people, with thy grace, in calling our solemn assembly, that it may be done to thine honor and to thy divine acceptance;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And in a manner that we may be found worthy, in thy sight, to secure a fulfilment of the promises which thou hast made unto us, thy people, in the revelations given unto us;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>That thy glory may rest down upon thy people, and upon this thy house, which we now dedicate to thee, that it may be sanctified and consecrated to be holy, and that thy holy presence may be continually in this house;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And that all people who shall enter upon the threshold of the Lord’s house may feel thy power, and feel constrained to acknowledge that thou hast sanctified it, and that it is thy house, a place of thy holiness.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And do thou grant, Holy Father, that all those who shall worship in this house may be taught words of wisdom out of the best books, and that they may seek learning even by study, and also by faith, as thou hast said;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And that they may grow up in thee, and receive a fulness of the Holy Ghost, and be organized according to thy laws, and be prepared to obtain every needful thing;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And that this house may be a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of glory and of God, even thy house;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>That all the incomings of thy people, into this house, may be in the name of the Lord;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>That all their outgoings from this house may be in the name of the Lord;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And that all their salutations may be in the name of the Lord, with holy hands, uplifted to the Most High;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And that no unclean thing shall be permitted to come into thy house to pollute it;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And when thy people transgress, any of them, they may speedily repent and return unto thee, and find favor in thy sight, and be restored to the blessings which thou hast ordained to be poured out upon those who shall reverence thee in thy house.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And we ask thee, Holy Father, that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And from this place they may bear exceedingly great and glorious tidings, in truth, unto the ends of the earth, that they may know that this is thy work, and that thou hast put forth thy hand, to fulfil that which thou hast spoken by the mouths of the prophets, concerning the last days.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>We ask thee, Holy Father, to establish the people that shall worship, and honorably hold a name and standing in this thy house, to all generations and for eternity;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>That no weapon formed against them shall prosper; that he who diggeth a pit for them shall fall into the same himself;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>That no combination of wickedness shall have power to rise up and prevail over thy people upon whom thy name shall be put in this house;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And if any people shall rise against this people, that thine anger be kindled against them;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And if they shall smite this people thou wilt smite them; thou wilt fight for thy people as thou didst in the day of battle, that they may be delivered from the hands of all their enemies.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>We ask thee, Holy Father, to confound, and astonish, and to bring to shame and confusion, all those who have spread lying reports abroad, over the world, against thy servant or servants, if they will not repent, when the everlasting gospel shall be proclaimed in their ears;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And that all their works may be brought to naught, and be swept away by the hail, and by the judgments which thou wilt send upon them in thine anger, that there may be an end to lyings and slanders against thy people.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>For thou knowest, O Lord, that thy servants have been innocent before thee in bearing record of thy name, for which they have suffered these things.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Therefore we plead before thee for a full and complete deliverance from under this yoke;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Break it off, O Lord; break it off from the necks of thy servants, by thy power, that we may rise up in the midst of this generation and do thy work.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>O Jehovah, have mercy upon this people, and as all men sin, forgive the transgressions of thy people, and let them be blotted out forever.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Let the anointing of thy ministers be sealed upon them with power from on high.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Let it be fulfilled upon them, as upon those on the day of Pentecost; let the gift of tongues be poured out upon thy people, even cloven tongues as of fire, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And let thy house be filled, as with a rushing mighty wind, with thy glory.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Put upon thy servants the testimony of the covenant, that when they go out and proclaim thy word they may seal up the law, and prepare the hearts of thy saints for all those judgments thou art about to send, in thy wrath, upon the inhabitants of the earth, because of their transgressions, that thy people may not faint in the day of trouble.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And whatsoever city thy servants shall enter, and the people of that city receive their testimony, let thy peace and thy salvation be upon that city; that they may gather out of that city the righteous, that they may come forth to Zion, or to her stakes, the places of thine appointment, with songs of everlasting joy;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And until this be accomplished, let not thy judgments fall upon that city.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And whatsoever city thy servants shall enter, and the people of that city receive not the testimony of thy servants, and thy servants warn them to save themselves from this untoward generation, let it be upon that city according to that which thou hast spoken by the mouths of thy prophets.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>But deliver thou, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, thy servants from their hands, and cleanse them from their blood.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>O Lord, we delight not in the destruction of our fellow men; their souls are precious before thee;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>But thy word must be fulfilled. Help thy servants to say, with thy grace assisting them: Thy will be done, O Lord, and not ours.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>We know that thou hast spoken by the mouth of thy prophets terrible things concerning the wicked, in the last days—that thou wilt pour out thy judgments, without measure;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Therefore, O Lord, deliver thy people from the calamity of the wicked; enable thy servants to seal up the law, and bind up the testimony, that they may be prepared against the day of burning.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>We ask thee, Holy Father, to remember those who have been driven by the inhabitants of Jackson county, Missouri, from the lands of their inheritance, and break off, O Lord, this yoke of affliction that has been put upon them.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>Thou knowest, O Lord, that they have been greatly oppressed and afflicted by wicked men; and our hearts flow out with sorrow because of their grievous burdens.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>O Lord, how long wilt thou suffer this people to bear this affliction, and the cries of their innocent ones to ascend up in thine ears, and their blood come up in testimony before thee, and not make a display of thy testimony in their behalf?</p>
    <p id="section-109_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>Have mercy, O Lord, upon the wicked mob, who have driven thy people, that they may cease to spoil, that they may repent of their sins if repentance is to be found;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>But if they will not, make bare thine arm, O Lord, and redeem that which thou didst appoint a Zion unto thy people.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And if it cannot be otherwise, that the cause of thy people may not fail before thee may thine anger be kindled, and thine indignation fall upon them, that they may be wasted away, both root and branch, from under heaven;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>But inasmuch as they will repent, thou art gracious and merciful, and wilt turn away thy wrath when thou lookest upon the face of thine Anointed.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our land; may those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>Remember the kings, the princes, the nobles, and the great ones of the earth, and all people, and the churches, all the poor, the needy, and afflicted ones of the earth;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>That their hearts may be softened when thy servants shall go out from thy house, O Jehovah, to bear testimony of thy name; that their prejudices may give way before the truth, and thy people may obtain favor in the sight of all;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>That all the ends of the earth may know that we, thy servants, have heard thy voice, and that thou hast sent us;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>That from among all these, thy servants, the sons of Jacob, may gather out the righteous to build a holy city to thy name, as thou hast commanded them.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>We ask thee to appoint unto Zion other stakes besides this one which thou hast appointed, that the gathering of thy people may roll on in great power and majesty, that thy work may be cut short in righteousness.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>Now these words, O Lord, we have spoken before thee, concerning the revelations and commandments which thou hast given unto us, who are identified with the Gentiles.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>But thou knowest that thou hast a great love for the children of Jacob, who have been scattered upon the mountains for a long time, in a cloudy and dark day.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>We therefore ask thee to have mercy upon the children of Jacob, that Jerusalem, from this hour, may begin to be redeemed;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>And the yoke of bondage may begin to be broken off from the house of David;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>And the children of Judah may begin to return to the lands which thou didst give to Abraham, their father.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>And cause that the remnants of Jacob, who have been cursed and smitten because of their transgression, be converted from their wild and savage condition to the fulness of the everlasting gospel;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>That they may lay down their weapons of bloodshed, and cease their rebellions.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>And may all the scattered remnants of Israel, who have been driven to the ends of the earth, come to a knowledge of the truth, believe in the Messiah, and be redeemed from oppression, and rejoice before thee.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>O Lord, remember thy servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., and all his afflictions and persecutions—how he has covenanted with Jehovah, and vowed to thee, O Mighty God of Jacob—and the commandments which thou hast given unto him, and that he hath sincerely striven to do thy will.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v69" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69 </span>Have mercy, O Lord, upon his wife and children, that they may be exalted in thy presence, and preserved by thy fostering hand.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v70" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70 </span>Have mercy upon all their immediate connections, that their prejudices may be broken up and swept away as with a flood; that they may be converted and redeemed with Israel, and know that thou art God.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v71" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71 </span>Remember, O Lord, the presidents, even all the presidents of thy church, that thy right hand may exalt them, with all their families, and their immediate connections, that their names may be perpetuated and had in everlasting remembrance from generation to generation.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v72" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72 </span>Remember all thy church, O Lord, with all their families, and all their immediate connections, with all their sick and afflicted ones, with all the poor and meek of the earth; that the kingdom, which thou hast set up without hands, may become a great mountain and fill the whole earth;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v73" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">73 </span>That thy church may come forth out of the wilderness of darkness, and shine forth fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v74" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74 </span>And be adorned as a bride for that day when thou shalt unveil the heavens, and cause the mountains to flow down at thy presence, and the valleys to be exalted, the rough places made smooth; that thy glory may fill the earth;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v75" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">75 </span>That when the trump shall sound for the dead, we shall be caught up in the cloud to meet thee, that we may ever be with the Lord;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v76" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">76 </span>That our garments may be pure, that we may be clothed upon with robes of righteousness, with palms in our hands, and crowns of glory upon our heads, and reap eternal joy for all our sufferings.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v77" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">77 </span>O Lord God Almighty, hear us in these our petitions, and answer us from heaven, thy holy habitation, where thou sittest enthroned, with glory, honor, power, majesty, might, dominion, truth, justice, judgment, mercy, and an infinity of fulness, from everlasting to everlasting.</p>
    <p id="section-109_v78" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">78 </span>O hear, O hear, O hear us, O Lord! And answer these petitions, and accept the dedication of this house unto thee, the work of our hands, which we have built unto thy name;</p>
    <p id="section-109_v79" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">79 </span>And also this church, to put upon it thy name. And help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!</p>
    <p id="section-109_v80" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">80 </span>And let these, thine anointed ones, be clothed with salvation, and thy saints shout aloud for joy. Amen, and Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-110_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened.</p>
    <p id="section-110_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.</p>
    <p id="section-110_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying:</p>
    <p id="section-110_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father.</p>

    <p id="section-110_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>After this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us; and Moses appeared before us, and committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north.</p>
    <p id="section-110_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>After this, Elias appeared, and committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham, saying that in us and our seed all generations after us should be blessed.</p>
    <p id="section-110_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said:</p>

    <p id="section-110_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.</p>

    <p id="section-112_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Thomas: I have heard thy prayers; and thine alms have come up as a memorial before me, in behalf of those, thy brethren, who were chosen to bear testimony of my name and to send it abroad among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, and ordained through the instrumentality of my servants.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Verily I say unto you, there have been some few things in thine heart and with thee with which I, the Lord, was not well pleased.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Nevertheless, inasmuch as thou hast abased thyself thou shalt be exalted; therefore, all thy sins are forgiven thee.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Let thy heart be of good cheer before my face; and thou shalt bear record of my name, not only unto the Gentiles, but also unto the Jews; and thou shalt send forth my word unto the ends of the earth.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Contend thou, therefore, morning by morning; and day after day let thy warning voice go forth; and when the night cometh let not the inhabitants of the earth slumber, because of thy speech.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Let thy habitation be known in Zion, and remove not thy house; for I, the Lord, have a great work for thee to do, in publishing my name among the children of men.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Therefore, gird up thy loins for the work. Let thy feet be shod also, for thou art chosen, and thy path lieth among the mountains, and among many nations.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And by thy word many high ones shall be brought low, and by thy word many low ones shall be exalted.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Thy voice shall be a rebuke unto the transgressor; and at thy rebuke let the tongue of the slanderer cease its perverseness.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>I know thy heart, and have heard thy prayers concerning thy brethren. Be not partial towards them in love above many others, but let thy love be for them as for thyself; and let thy love abound unto all men, and unto all who love my name.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And pray for thy brethren of the Twelve. Admonish them sharply for my name’s sake, and let them be admonished for all their sins, and be ye faithful before me unto my name.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And after their temptations, and much tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts, and stiffen not their necks against me, they shall be converted, and I will heal them.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Now, I say unto you, and what I say unto you, I say unto all the Twelve: Arise and gird up your loins, take up your cross, follow me, and feed my sheep.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Exalt not yourselves; rebel not against my servant Joseph; for verily I say unto you, I am with him, and my hand shall be over him; and the keys which I have given unto him, and also to youward, shall not be taken from him till I come.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Verily I say unto you, my servant Thomas, thou art the man whom I have chosen to hold the keys of my kingdom, as pertaining to the Twelve, abroad among all nations—</p>

    <p id="section-112_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Whosoever receiveth my word receiveth me, and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth those, the First Presidency, whom I have sent, whom I have made counselors for my name’s sake unto you.</p>

    <p id="section-112_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Inasmuch as they shall humble themselves before me, and abide in my word, and hearken to the voice of my Spirit.</p>

    <p id="section-112_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Behold, vengeance cometh speedily upon the inhabitants of the earth, a day of wrath, a day of burning, a day of desolation, of weeping, of mourning, and of lamentation; and as a whirlwind it shall come upon all the face of the earth, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And upon my house shall it begin, and from my house shall it go forth, saith the Lord;</p>
    <p id="section-112_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>First among those among you, saith the Lord, who have professed to know my name and have not known me, and have blasphemed against me in the midst of my house, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Therefore, see to it that ye trouble not yourselves concerning the affairs of my church in this place, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>But purify your hearts before me; and then go ye into all the world, and preach my gospel unto every creature who has not received it;</p>
    <p id="section-112_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>For unto you, the Twelve, and those, the First Presidency, who are appointed with you to be your counselors and your leaders, is the power of this priesthood given, for the last days and for the last time, in the which is the dispensation of the fulness of times,</p>
    <p id="section-112_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Which power you hold, in connection with all those who have received a dispensation at any time from the beginning of the creation;</p>
    <p id="section-112_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>For verily I say unto you, the keys of the dispensation, which ye have received, have come down from the fathers, and last of all, being sent down from heaven unto you.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Verily I say unto you, behold how great is your calling. Cleanse your hearts and your garments, lest the blood of this generation be required at your hands.</p>
    <p id="section-112_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Be faithful until I come, for I come quickly; and my reward is with me to recompense every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-113_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Verily thus saith the Lord: It is Christ.</p>
    <p id="section-113_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>What is the rod spoken of in the first verse of the 11th chapter of Isaiah, that should come of the Stem of Jesse?</p>
    <p id="section-113_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Behold, thus saith the Lord: It is a servant in the hands of Christ, who is partly a descendant of Jesse as well as of Ephraim, or of the house of Joseph, on whom there is laid much power.</p>

    <p id="section-113_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>He had reference to those whom God should call in the last days, who should hold the power of priesthood to bring again Zion, and the redemption of Israel; and to put on her strength is to put on the authority of the priesthood, which she, Zion, has a right to by lineage; also to return to that power which she had lost.</p>
    <p id="section-113_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>What are we to understand by Zion loosing herself from the bands of her neck; 2d verse?</p>
    <p id="section-113_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>We are to understand that the scattered remnants are exhorted to return to the Lord from whence they have fallen; which if they do, the promise of the Lord is that he will speak to them, or give them revelation. See the 6th, 7th, and 8th verses. The bands of her neck are the curses of God upon her, or the remnants of Israel in their scattered condition among the Gentiles.</p>

    <p id="section-121_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?</p>
    <p id="section-121_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?</p>
    <p id="section-121_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>O Lord God Almighty, maker of heaven, earth, and seas, and of all things that in them are, and who controllest and subjectest the devil, and the dark and benighted dominion of Sheol—stretch forth thy hand; let thine eye pierce; let thy pavilion be taken up; let thy hiding place no longer be covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine heart be softened, and thy bowels moved with compassion toward us.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Let thine anger be kindled against our enemies; and, in the fury of thine heart, with thy sword avenge us of our wrongs.</p>

    <p id="section-121_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</p>
    <p id="section-121_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And they who do charge thee with transgression, their hope shall be blasted, and their prospects shall melt away as the hoar frost melteth before the burning rays of the rising sun;</p>
    <p id="section-121_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And also that God hath set his hand and seal to change the times and seasons, and to blind their minds, that they may not understand his marvelous workings; that he may prove them also and take them in their own craftiness;</p>
    <p id="section-121_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Also because their hearts are corrupted, and the things which they are willing to bring upon others, and love to have others suffer, may come upon themselves to the very uttermost;</p>
    <p id="section-121_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>That they may be disappointed also, and their hopes may be cut off;</p>

    <p id="section-121_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves.</p>

    <p id="section-121_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish, and they themselves shall be despised by those that flattered them.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>They shall not have right to the priesthood, nor their posterity after them from generation to generation.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>It had been better for them that a millstone had been hanged about their necks, and they drowned in the depth of the sea.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Wo unto all those that discomfort my people, and drive, and murder, and testify against them, saith the Lord of Hosts; a generation of vipers shall not escape the damnation of hell.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Behold, mine eyes see and know all their works, and I have in reserve a swift judgment in the season thereof, for them all;</p>

    <p id="section-121_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now;</p>
    <p id="section-121_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Which our forefathers have awaited with anxious expectation to be revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to by the angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of their glory;</p>
    <p id="section-121_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God or many gods, they shall be manifest.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars—</p>
    <p id="section-121_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>All the times of their revolutions, all the appointed days, months, and years, and all the days of their days, months, and years, and all their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times—</p>
    <p id="section-121_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>According to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other gods before this world was, that should be reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof, when every man shall enter into his eternal presence and into his immortal rest.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?</p>
    <p id="section-121_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson—</p>
    <p id="section-121_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, to persecute the saints, and to fight against God.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>Hence many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</p>
    <p id="section-121_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile—</p>
    <p id="section-121_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;</p>
    <p id="section-121_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-121_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</p>

    <p id="section-122_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;</p>

O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;</p>

    <p id="section-122_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?</p>

    <h2 id="section-123" class="chapter-title">Section 123</h2>
    <p id="section-123_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And again, we would suggest for your consideration the propriety of all the saints gathering up a knowledge of all the facts, and sufferings and abuses put upon them by the people of this State;</p>
    <p id="section-123_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And also of all the property and amount of damages which they have sustained, both of character and personal injuries, as well as real property;</p>
    <p id="section-123_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And also the names of all persons that have had a hand in their oppressions, as far as they can get hold of them and find them out.</p>
    <p id="section-123_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And perhaps a committee can be appointed to find out these things, and to take statements and affidavits; and also to gather up the libelous publications that are afloat;</p>
    <p id="section-123_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And all that are in the magazines, and in the encyclopedias, and all the libelous histories that are published, and are writing, and by whom, and present the whole concatenation of diabolical rascality and nefarious and murderous impositions that have been practiced upon this people—</p>
    <p id="section-123_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>That we may not only publish to all the world, but present them to the heads of government in all their dark and hellish hue, as the last effort which is enjoined on us by our Heavenly Father, before we can fully and completely claim that promise which shall call him forth from his hiding place; and also that the whole nation may be left without excuse before he can send forth the power of his mighty arm.</p>
    <p id="section-123_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>It is an imperative duty that we owe to God, to angels, with whom we shall be brought to stand, and also to ourselves, to our wives and children, who have been made to bow down with grief, sorrow, and care, under the most damning hand of murder, tyranny, and oppression, supported and urged on and upheld by the influence of that spirit which hath so strongly riveted the creeds of the fathers, who have inherited lies, upon the hearts of the children, and filled the world with confusion, and has been growing stronger and stronger, and is now the very mainspring of all corruption, and the whole earth groans under the weight of its iniquity.</p>
    <p id="section-123_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>It is an iron yoke, it is a strong band; they are the very handcuffs, and chains, and shackles, and fetters of hell.</p>
    <p id="section-123_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Therefore it is an imperative duty that we owe, not only to our own wives and children, but to the widows and fatherless, whose husbands and fathers have been murdered under its iron hand;</p>
    <p id="section-123_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Which dark and blackening deeds are enough to make hell itself shudder, and to stand aghast and pale, and the hands of the very devil to tremble and palsy.</p>
    <p id="section-123_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And also it is an imperative duty that we owe to all the rising generation, and to all the pure in heart—</p>
    <p id="section-123_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>For there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it—</p>
    <p id="section-123_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Therefore, that we should waste and wear out our lives in bringing to light all the hidden things of darkness, wherein we know them; and they are truly manifest from heaven—</p>
    <p id="section-123_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>These should then be attended to with great earnestness.</p>
    <p id="section-123_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Let no man count them as small things; for there is much which lieth in futurity, pertaining to the saints, which depends upon these things.</p>
    <p id="section-123_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>You know, brethren, that a very large ship is benefited very much by a very small helm in the time of a storm, by being kept workways with the wind and the waves.</p>
    <p id="section-123_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</p>

    <p id="section-124_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>This proclamation shall be made to all the kings of the world, to the four corners thereof, to the honorable president-elect, and the high-minded governors of the nation in which you live, and to all the nations of the earth scattered abroad.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Let it be written in the spirit of meekness and by the power of the Holy Ghost, which shall be in you at the time of the writing of the same;</p>
    <p id="section-124_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>For it shall be given you by the Holy Ghost to know my will concerning those kings and authorities, even what shall befall them in a time to come.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>For, behold, I am about to call upon them to give heed to the light and glory of Zion, for the set time has come to favor her.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Call ye, therefore, upon them with loud proclamation, and with your testimony, fearing them not, for they are as grass, and all their glory as the flower thereof which soon falleth, that they may be left also without excuse—</p>
    <p id="section-124_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And that I may visit them in the day of visitation, when I shall unveil the face of my covering, to appoint the portion of the oppressor among hypocrites, where there is gnashing of teeth, if they reject my servants and my testimony which I have revealed unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And again, I will visit and soften their hearts, many of them for your good, that ye may find grace in their eyes, that they may come to the light of truth, and the Gentiles to the exaltation or lifting up of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>For the day of my visitation cometh speedily, in an hour when ye think not of; and where shall be the safety of my people, and refuge for those who shall be left of them?</p>
    <p id="section-124_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Awake, O kings of the earth! Come ye, O, come ye, with your gold and your silver, to the help of my people, to the house of the daughters of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Robert B. Thompson help you to write this proclamation, for I am well pleased with him, and that he should be with you;</p>
    <p id="section-124_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Let him, therefore, hearken to your counsel, and I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings; let him be faithful and true in all things from henceforth, and he shall be great in mine eyes;</p>
    <p id="section-124_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But let him remember that his stewardship will I require at his hands.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Again, let my servant John C.

    <p id="section-124_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And for his love he shall be great, for he shall be mine if he do this, saith the Lord. I have seen the work which he hath done, which I accept if he continue, and will crown him with blessings and great glory.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And again, I say unto you that it is my will that my servant Lyman Wight should continue in preaching for Zion, in the spirit of meekness, confessing me before the world; and I will bear him up as on eagles’ wings; and he shall beget glory and honor to himself and unto my name.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>That when he shall finish his work I may receive him unto myself, even as I did my servant David Patten, who is with me at this time, and also my servant Edward Partridge, and also my aged servant Joseph Smith, Sen., who sitteth with Abraham at his right hand, and blessed and holy is he, for he is mine.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, my servant George Miller is without guile; he may be trusted because of the integrity of his heart; and for the love which he has to my testimony I, the Lord, love him.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>I therefore say unto you, I seal upon his head the office of a bishopric, like unto my servant Edward Partridge, that he may receive the consecrations of mine house, that he may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor of my people, saith the Lord. Let no man despise my servant George, for he shall honor me.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Let my servant George, and my servant Lyman, and my servant John Snider, and others, build a house unto my name, such a one as my servant Joseph shall show unto them, upon the place which he shall show unto them also.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And it shall be for a house for boarding, a house that strangers may come from afar to lodge therein; therefore let it be a good house, worthy of all acceptation, that the weary traveler may find health and safety while he shall contemplate the word of the Lord; and the cornerstone I have appointed for Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>This house shall be a healthful habitation if it be built unto my name, and if the governor which shall be appointed unto it shall not suffer any pollution to come upon it. It shall be holy, or the Lord your God will not dwell therein.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, let all my saints come from afar.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And send ye swift messengers, yea, chosen messengers, and say unto them: Come ye, with all your gold, and your silver, and your precious stones, and with all your antiquities; and with all who have knowledge of antiquities, that will come, may come, and bring the box tree, and the fir tree, and the pine tree, together with all the precious trees of the earth;</p>
    <p id="section-124_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And with iron, with copper, and with brass, and with zinc, and with all your precious things of the earth; and build a house to my name, for the Most High to dwell therein.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>For there is not a place found on earth that he may come to and restore again that which was lost unto you, or which he hath taken away, even the fulness of the priesthood.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>For a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my saints, may be baptized for those who are dead—</p>
    <p id="section-124_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>For this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be acceptable to me, only in the days of your poverty, wherein ye are not able to build a house unto me.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>But I command you, all ye my saints, to build a house unto me; and I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me; and during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>But behold, at the end of this appointment your baptisms for your dead shall not be acceptable unto me; and if you do not these things at the end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a church, with your dead, saith the Lord your God.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>For verily I say unto you, that after you have had sufficient time to build a house to me, wherein the ordinance of baptizing for the dead belongeth, and for which the same was instituted from before the foundation of the world, your baptisms for your dead cannot be acceptable unto me;</p>
    <p id="section-124_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>For therein are the keys of the holy priesthood ordained, that you may receive honor and glory.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And after this time, your baptisms for the dead, by those who are scattered abroad, are not acceptable unto me, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>For it is ordained that in Zion, and in her stakes, and in Jerusalem, those places which I have appointed for refuge, shall be the places for your baptisms for your dead.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, how shall your washings be acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you have built to my name?</p>
    <p id="section-124_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>For, for this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a tabernacle, that they should bear it with them in the wilderness, and to build a house in the land of promise, that those ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices by the sons of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes and judgments, for the beginning of the revelations and foundation of Zion, and for the glory, honor, and endowment of all her municipals, are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And verily I say unto you, let this house be built unto my name, that I may reveal mine ordinances therein unto my people;</p>
    <p id="section-124_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>For I deign to reveal unto my church things which have been kept hid from before the foundation of the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the fulness of times.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And I will show unto my servant Joseph all things pertaining to this house, and the priesthood thereof, and the place whereon it shall be built.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And ye shall build it on the place where you have contemplated building it, for that is the spot which I have chosen for you to build it.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>If ye labor with all your might, I will consecrate that spot that it shall be made holy.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>And if my people will hearken unto my voice, and unto the voice of my servants whom I have appointed to lead my people, behold, verily I say unto you, they shall not be moved out of their place.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>But if they will not hearken to my voice, nor unto the voice of these men whom I have appointed, they shall not be blest, because they pollute mine holy grounds, and mine holy ordinances, and charters, and my holy words which I give unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And it shall come to pass that if you build a house unto my name, and do not do the things that I say, I will not perform the oath which I make unto you, neither fulfil the promises which ye expect at my hands, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>For instead of blessings, ye, by your own works, bring cursings, wrath, indignation, and judgments upon your own heads, by your follies, and by all your abominations, which you practice before me, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that when I give a commandment to any of the sons of men to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them and hinder them from performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to accept of their offerings.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and commandments I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord God.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>Therefore, for this cause have I accepted the offerings of those whom I commanded to build up a city and a house unto my name, in Jackson county, Missouri, and were hindered by their enemies, saith the Lord your God.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And I will answer judgment, wrath, and indignation, wailing, and anguish, and gnashing of teeth upon their heads, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord your God.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>And this I make an example unto you, for your consolation concerning all those who have been commanded to do a work and have been hindered by the hands of their enemies, and by oppression, saith the Lord your God.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>For I am the Lord your God, and will save all those of your brethren who have been pure in heart, and have been slain in the land of Missouri, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, I command you again to build a house to my name, even in this place, that you may prove yourselves unto me that ye are faithful in all things whatsoever I command you, that I may bless you, and crown you with honor, immortality, and eternal life.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And now I say unto you, as pertaining to my boarding house which I have commanded you to build for the boarding of strangers, let it be built unto my name, and let my name be named upon it, and let my servant Joseph and his house have place therein, from generation to generation.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>For this anointing have I put upon his head, that his blessing shall also be put upon the head of his posterity after him.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>And as I said unto Abraham concerning the kindreds of the earth, even so I say unto my servant Joseph: In thee and in thy seed shall the kindred of the earth be blessed.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>Therefore, let my servant Joseph and his seed after him have place in that house, from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>And let the name of that house be called Nauvoo House; and let it be a delightful habitation for man, and a resting-place for the weary traveler, that he may contemplate the glory of Zion, and the glory of this, the cornerstone thereof;</p>
    <p id="section-124_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>That he may receive also the counsel from those whom I have set to be as plants of renown, and as watchmen upon her walls.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>Behold, verily I say unto you, let my servant George Miller, and my servant Lyman Wight, and my servant John Snider, and my servant Peter Haws, organize themselves, and appoint one of them to be a president over their quorum for the purpose of building that house.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>And they shall form a constitution, whereby they may receive stock for the building of that house.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>And they shall not receive less than fifty dollars for a share of stock in that house, and they shall be permitted to receive fifteen thousand dollars from any one man for stock in that house.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>But they shall not be permitted to receive over fifteen thousand dollars stock from any one man.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>And they shall not be permitted to receive under fifty dollars for a share of stock from any one man in that house.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>And they shall not be permitted to receive any man, as a stockholder in this house, except the same shall pay his stock into their hands at the time he receives stock;</p>
    <p id="section-124_v68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>And in proportion to the amount of stock he pays into their hands he shall receive stock in that house; but if he pays nothing into their hands he shall not receive any stock in that house.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v69" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69 </span>And if any pay stock into their hands it shall be for stock in that house, for himself, and for his generation after him, from generation to generation, so long as he and his heirs shall hold that stock, and do not sell or convey the stock away out of their hands by their own free will and act, if you will do my will, saith the Lord your God.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v70" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, if my servant George Miller, and my servant Lyman Wight, and my servant John Snider, and my servant Peter Haws, receive any stock into their hands, in moneys, or in properties wherein they receive the real value of moneys, they shall not appropriate any portion of that stock to any other purpose, only in that house.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v71" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71 </span>And if they do appropriate any portion of that stock anywhere else, only in that house, without the consent of the stockholder, and do not repay four-fold for the stock which they appropriate anywhere else, only in that house, they shall be accursed, and shall be moved out of their place, saith the Lord God; for I, the Lord, am God, and cannot be mocked in any of these things.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v72" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72 </span>Verily I say unto you, let my servant Joseph pay stock into their hands for the building of that house, as seemeth him good; but my servant Joseph cannot pay over fifteen thousand dollars stock in that house, nor under fifty dollars; neither can any other man, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v73" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">73 </span>And there are others also who wish to know my will concerning them, for they have asked it at my hands.</p>
    <p id="section-124_v74" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74 </span>Therefore, I say unto you concerning my servant Vinson Knight, if he will do my will let him put stock into that house for himself, and for his generation after him, from generation to generation.</p>

    <h2 id="section-127" class="chapter-title">Section 127</h2>
    <p id="section-127_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Forasmuch as the Lord has revealed unto me that my enemies, both in Missouri and this State, were again in the pursuit of me; and inasmuch as they pursue me without a cause, and have not the least shadow or coloring of justice or right on their side in the getting up of their prosecutions against me; and inasmuch as their pretensions are all founded in falsehood of the blackest dye, I have thought it expedient and wisdom in me to leave the place for a short season, for my own safety and the safety of this people. I would say to all those with whom I have business, that I have left my affairs with agents and clerks who will transact all business in a prompt and proper manner, and will see that all my debts are canceled in due time, by turning out property, or otherwise, as the case may require, or as the circumstances may admit of. When I learn that the storm is fully blown over, then I will return to you again.</p>
    <p id="section-127_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And as for the perils which I am called to pass through, they seem but a small thing to me, as the envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days of my life; and for what cause it seems mysterious, unless I was ordained from before the foundation of the world for some good end, or bad, as you may choose to call it. Judge ye for yourselves. God knoweth all these things, whether it be good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation; for to this day has the God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p>
    <p id="section-127_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Let all the saints rejoice, therefore, and be exceedingly glad; for Israel’s God is their God, and he will mete out a just recompense of reward upon the heads of all their oppressors.</p>

And if they persecute you, so persecuted they the prophets and righteous men that were before you. For all this there is a reward in heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-127_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And again, I give unto you a word in relation to the baptism for your dead.</p>
    <p id="section-127_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning your dead: When any of you are baptized for your dead, let there be a recorder, and let him be eye-witness of your baptisms; let him hear with his ears, that he may testify of a truth, saith the Lord;</p>
    <p id="section-127_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>That in all your recordings it may be recorded in heaven; whatsoever you bind on earth, may be bound in heaven; whatsoever you loose on earth, may be loosed in heaven;</p>
    <p id="section-127_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>For I am about to restore many things to the earth, pertaining to the priesthood, saith the Lord of Hosts.</p>
    <p id="section-127_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And again, let all the records be had in order, that they may be put in the archives of my holy temple, to be held in remembrance from generation to generation, saith the Lord of Hosts.</p>
    <p id="section-127_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>I will say to all the saints, that I desired, with exceedingly great desire, to have addressed them from the stand on the subject of baptism for the dead, on the following Sabbath. But inasmuch as it is out of my power to do so, I will write the word of the Lord from time to time, on that subject, and send it to you by mail, as well as many other things.</p>
    <p id="section-127_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>I now close my letter for the present, for the want of more time; for the enemy is on the alert, and as the Savior said, the prince of this world cometh, but he hath nothing in me.</p>

    <h2 id="section-128" class="chapter-title">Section 128</h2>
    <p id="section-128_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>As I stated to you in my letter before I left my place, that I would write to you from time to time and give you information in relation to many subjects, I now resume the subject of the baptism for the dead, as that subject seems to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest, since I have been pursued by my enemies.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>I wrote a few words of revelation to you concerning a recorder. I have had a few additional views in relation to this matter, which I now certify. That is, it was declared in my former letter that there should be a recorder, who should be eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he might make a record of a truth before the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Now, in relation to this matter, it would be very difficult for one recorder to be present at all times, and to do all the business. To obviate this difficulty, there can be a recorder appointed in each ward of the city, who is well qualified for taking accurate minutes; and let him be very particular and precise in taking the whole proceedings, certifying in his record that he saw with his eyes, and heard with his ears, giving the date, and names, and so forth, and the history of the whole transaction; naming also some three individuals that are present, if there be any present, who can at any time when called upon certify to the same, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Then, let there be a general recorder, to whom these other records can be handed, being attended with certificates over their own signatures, certifying that the record they have made is true. Then the general church recorder can enter the record on the general church book, with the certificates and all the attending witnesses, with his own statement that he verily believes the above statement and records to be true, from his knowledge of the general character and appointment of those men by the church. And when this is done on the general church book, the record shall be just as holy, and shall answer the ordinance just the same as if he had seen with his eyes and heard with his ears, and made a record of the same on the general church book.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>You may think this order of things to be very particular; but let me tell you that it is only to answer the will of God, by conforming to the ordinance and preparation that the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation of the world, for the salvation of the dead who should die without a knowledge of the gospel.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And further, I want you to remember that John the Revelator was contemplating this very subject in relation to the dead, when he declared, as you will find recorded in Revelation 20:12—<em>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</em></p>
    <p id="section-128_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened; and another book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works; consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the record of their works, and refer to the records which are kept on the earth. And the book which was the book of life is the record which is kept in heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with the doctrine which is commanded you in the revelation contained in the letter which I wrote to you previous to my leaving my place—that in all your recordings it may be recorded in heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the priesthood, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in heaven, and whatsoever you do not record on earth shall not be recorded in heaven; for out of the books shall your dead be judged, according to their own works, whether they themselves have attended to the ordinances in their own <i>propria persona,</i> or by the means of their own agents, according to the ordinance which God has prepared for their salvation from before the foundation of the world, according to the records which they have kept concerning their dead.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of—a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the priesthood to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this power has always been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, in the name of the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven, and could not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is a faithful saying. Who can hear it?</p>
    <p id="section-128_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And again, for the precedent, Matthew 16:18, 19: <em>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</em></p>
    <p id="section-128_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Now the great and grand secret of the whole matter, and the <i>summum bonum</i> of the whole subject that is lying before us, consists in obtaining the powers of the Holy Priesthood. For him to whom these keys are given there is no difficulty in obtaining a knowledge of facts in relation to the salvation of the children of men, both as well for the dead as for the living.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and eternal life—The ordinance of baptism by water, to be immersed therein in order to answer to the likeness of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other; to be immersed in the water and come forth out of the water is in the likeness of the resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their graves; hence, this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with the ordinance of baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Consequently, the baptismal font was instituted as a similitude of the grave, and was commanded to be in a place underneath where the living are wont to assemble, to show forth the living and the dead, and that all things may have their likeness, and that they may accord one with another—that which is earthly conforming to that which is heavenly, as Paul hath declared, 1 Corinthians 15:46, 47, and 48:</p>
    <p id="section-128_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span><em>Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</em> And as are the records on the earth in relation to your dead, which are truly made out, so also are the records in heaven. This, therefore, is the sealing and binding power, and, in one sense of the word, the keys of the kingdom, which consist in the key of knowledge.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, as Paul says concerning the fathers—that they without us cannot be made perfect—neither can we without our dead be made perfect.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And now, in relation to the baptism for the dead, I will give you another quotation of Paul, 1 Corinthians 15:29: <em>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?</em></p>
    <p id="section-128_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And again, in connection with this quotation I will give you a quotation from one of the prophets, who had his eye fixed on the restoration of the priesthood, the glories to be revealed in the last days, and in an especial manner this most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting gospel, namely, the baptism for the dead; for Malachi says, last chapter, verses 5th and 6th: <em>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</em></p>
    <p id="section-128_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other—and behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and that say unto Zion: Behold, thy God reigneth! As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them!</p>
    <p id="section-128_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets—the book to be revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca county, declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the book! The voice of Michael on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devil when he appeared as an angel of light! The voice of Peter, James, and John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville, Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times!</p>
    <p id="section-128_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old Father Whitmer, in Fayette, Seneca county, and at sundry times, and in divers places through all the travels and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! And the voice of Michael, the archangel; the voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam down to the present time, all declaring their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of their priesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little; giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to come, confirming our hope!</p>
    <p id="section-128_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and powers!</p>
    <p id="section-128_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand; and who can abide the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appeareth? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap; and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Let us, therefore, as a church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints, offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; and let us present in his holy temple, when it is finished, a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation.</p>
    <p id="section-128_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Brethren, I have many things to say to you on the subject; but shall now close for the present, and continue the subject another time. I am, as ever, your humble servant and never deviating friend,</p>

    <p id="section-129_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>There are two kinds of beings in heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected personages, having bodies of flesh and bones—</p>
    <p id="section-129_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For instance, Jesus said: <em>Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</em></p>
    <p id="section-129_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect, they who are not resurrected, but inherit the same glory.</p>
    <p id="section-129_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you.</p>
    <p id="section-129_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.</p>
    <p id="section-129_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for that is the only way he can appear—</p>
    <p id="section-129_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still deliver his message.</p>
    <p id="section-129_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>If it be the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore detect him.</p>

    <p id="section-130_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>When the Savior shall appear we shall see him as he is. We shall see that he is a man like ourselves.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And that same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now enjoy.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>John 14:23—The appearing of the Father and the Son, in that verse, is a personal appearance; and the idea that the Father and the Son dwell in a man’s heart is an old sectarian notion, and is false.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>In answer to the question—Is not the reckoning of God’s time, angel’s time, prophet’s time, and man’s time, according to the planet on which they reside?</p>
    <p id="section-130_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>I answer, Yes. But there are no angels who minister to this earth but those who do belong or have belonged to it.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>The angels do not reside on a planet like this earth;</p>
    <p id="section-130_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>But they reside in the presence of God, on a globe like a sea of glass and fire, where all things for their glory are manifest, past, present, and future, and are continually before the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>The place where God resides is a great Urim and Thummim.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>This earth, in its sanctified and immortal state, will be made like unto crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell thereon, whereby all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom, or all kingdoms of a lower order, will be manifest to those who dwell on it; and this earth will be Christ’s.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Then the white stone mentioned in Revelation 2:17, will become a Urim and Thummim to each individual who receives one, whereby things pertaining to a higher order of kingdoms will be made known;</p>
    <p id="section-130_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And a white stone is given to each of those who come into the celestial kingdom, whereon is a new name written, which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it. The new name is the key word.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>I prophesy, in the name of the Lord God, that the commencement of the difficulties which will cause much bloodshed previous to the coming of the Son of Man will be in South Carolina.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>It may probably arise through the slave question. This a voice declared to me, while I was praying earnestly on the subject, December 25th, 1832.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>I was once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the Son of Man, when I heard a voice repeat the following:</p>
    <p id="section-130_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five years old, thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man; therefore let this suffice, and trouble me no more on this matter.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>I was left thus, without being able to decide whether this coming referred to the beginning of the millennium or to some previous appearing, or whether I should die and thus see his face.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>I believe the coming of the Son of Man will not be any sooner than that time.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—</p>
    <p id="section-130_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</p>
    <p id="section-130_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.</p>

    <p id="section-132_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand to know and understand wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines—</p>
    <p id="section-132_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Behold, and lo, I am the Lord thy God, and will answer thee as touching this matter.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are these: All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Will I accept of an offering, saith the Lord, that is not made in my name?</p>

    <p id="section-132_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord, except it be by law, even as I and my Father ordained unto you, before the world was?</p>
    <p id="section-132_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>I am the Lord thy God; and I give unto you this commandment—that no man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word, which is my law, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be, that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your God.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things are not by me shall be shaken and destroyed.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world it cannot be received there, because the angels and the gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, inherit my glory; for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them—Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths—then shall it be written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to this glory.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives, and few there be that find it, because ye receive me not in the world neither do ye know me.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation; that where I am ye shall be also.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>This is eternal lives—to know the only wise and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. I am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Broad is the gate, and wide the way that leadeth to the deaths; and many there are that go in thereat, because they receive me not, neither do they abide in my law.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she shall commit any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder wherein they shed innocent blood, yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter into their exaltation; but they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the world nor out of the world, is in that ye commit murder wherein ye shed innocent blood, and assent unto my death, after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law can in nowise enter into my glory, but shall be damned, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>I am the Lord thy God, and will give unto thee the law of my Holy Priesthood, as was ordained by me and my Father before the world was.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandment, by my word, saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation and sitteth upon his throne.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Abraham received promises concerning his seed, and of the fruit of his loins—from whose loins ye are, namely, my servant Joseph—which were to continue so long as they were in the world; and as touching Abraham and his seed, out of the world they should continue; both in the world and out of the world should they continue as innumerable as the stars; or, if ye were to count the sand upon the seashore ye could not number them.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>This promise is yours also, because ye are of Abraham, and the promise was made unto Abraham; and by this law is the continuation of the works of my Father, wherein he glorifieth himself.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham; enter ye into my law and ye shall be saved.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>But if ye enter not into my law ye cannot receive the promise of my Father, which he made unto Abraham.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to wife. And why did she do it? Because this was the law; and from Hagar sprang many people. This, therefore, was fulfilling, among other things, the promises.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Was Abraham, therefore, under condemnation? Verily I say unto you, Nay; for I, the Lord, commanded it.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Abraham was commanded to offer his son Isaac; nevertheless, it was written: Thou shalt not kill. Abraham, however, did not refuse, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>Abraham received concubines, and they bore him children; and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in my law; as Isaac also and Jacob did none other things than that which they were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they received not of me.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>David’s wives and concubines were given unto him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>I am the Lord thy God, and I gave unto thee, my servant Joseph, an appointment, and restore all things. Ask what ye will, and it shall be given unto you according to my word.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And as ye have asked concerning adultery, verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the holy anointing, she hath committed adultery and shall be destroyed.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>If she be not in the new and everlasting covenant, and she be with another man, she has committed adultery.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And if her husband be with another woman, and he was under a vow, he hath broken his vow and hath committed adultery.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent and hath not broken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood, to take her and give her unto him that hath not committed adultery but hath been faithful; for he shall be made ruler over many.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>For I have conferred upon you the keys and power of the priesthood, wherein I restore all things, and make known unto you all things in due time.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And verily, verily, I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my name and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens; and whosesoever sins you remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in the heavens; and whosesoever sins you retain on earth shall be retained in heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless I will bless, and whomsoever you curse I will curse, saith the Lord; for I, the Lord, am thy God.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And again, verily I say unto you, my servant Joseph, that whatsoever you give on earth, and to whomsoever you give any one on earth, by my word and according to my law, it shall be visited with blessings and not cursings, and with my power, saith the Lord, and shall be without condemnation on earth and in heaven.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>For I am the Lord thy God, and will be with thee even unto the end of the world, and through all eternity; for verily I seal upon you your exaltation, and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my Father, with Abraham your father.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>Behold, I have seen your sacrifices, and will forgive all your sins; I have seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which I have told you. Go, therefore, and I make a way for your escape, as I accepted the offering of Abraham of his son Isaac.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>Verily, I say unto you: A commandment I give unto mine handmaid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, that she stay herself and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her; for I did it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require an offering at your hand, by covenant and sacrifice.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>For I am the Lord thy God, and ye shall obey my voice; and I give unto my servant Joseph that he shall be made ruler over many things; for he hath been faithful over a few things, and from henceforth I will strengthen him.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply him and give unto him an hundred-fold in this world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her, and multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy; for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold, and lo, I am with him, as I was with Abraham, thy father, even unto his exaltation and glory.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>Now, as touching the law of the priesthood, there are many things pertaining thereunto.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was Aaron, by mine own voice, and by the voice of him that sent me, and I have endowed him with the keys of the power of this priesthood, if he do anything in my name, and according to my law and by my word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify him.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I require at his hands for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood—if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>And if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him; therefore is he justified.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood, as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and administer unto him, or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word; and she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife.</p>
    <p id="section-132_v66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>And now, as pertaining to this law, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will reveal more unto you, hereafter; therefore, let this suffice for the present. Behold, I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-133_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Go ye out from Babylon. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.</p>

    <p id="section-133_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Yea, verily I say unto you again, the time has come when the voice of the Lord is unto you: Go ye out of Babylon; gather ye out from among the nations, from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Send forth the elders of my church unto the nations which are afar off; unto the islands of the sea; send forth unto foreign lands; call upon all nations, first upon the Gentiles, and then upon the Jews.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And behold, and lo, this shall be their cry, and the voice of the Lord unto all people: Go ye forth unto the land of Zion, that the borders of my people may be enlarged, and that her stakes may be strengthened, and that Zion may go forth unto the regions round about.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Yea, let the cry go forth among all people: Awake and arise and go forth to meet the Bridegroom; behold and lo, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Let them, therefore, who are among the Gentiles flee unto Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And let them who be of Judah flee unto Jerusalem, unto the mountains of the Lord’s house.</p>

    <p id="section-133_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>But verily, thus saith the Lord, let not your flight be in haste, but let all things be prepared before you; and he that goeth, let him not look back lest sudden destruction shall come upon him.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Hearken and hear, O ye inhabitants of the earth. Listen, ye elders of my church together, and hear the voice of the Lord; for he calleth upon all men, and he commandeth all men everywhere to repent.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For behold, the Lord God hath sent forth the angel crying through the midst of heaven, saying: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight, for the hour of his coming is nigh—</p>

    <p id="section-133_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And this gospel shall be preached unto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And the servants of God shall go forth, saying with a loud voice: Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come;</p>
    <p id="section-133_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters—</p>
    <p id="section-133_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>Calling upon the name of the Lord day and night, saying: O that thou wouldst rend the heavens, that thou wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And it shall be answered upon their heads; for the presence of the Lord shall be as the melting fire that burneth, and as the fire which causeth the waters to boil.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>O Lord, thou shalt come down to make thy name known to thine adversaries, and all nations shall tremble at thy presence—</p>

    <p id="section-133_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>For since the beginning of the world have not men heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath any eye seen, O God, besides thee, how great things thou hast prepared for him that waiteth for thee.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And it shall be said: Who is this that cometh down from God in heaven with dyed garments; yea, from the regions which are not known, clothed in his glorious apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength?</p>
    <p id="section-133_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And he shall say: I am he who spake in righteousness, mighty to save.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And the Lord shall be red in his apparel, and his garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>And so great shall be the glory of his presence that the sun shall hide his face in shame, and the moon shall withhold its light, and the stars shall be hurled from their places.</p>
    <p id="section-133_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And his voice shall be heard: I have trodden the wine-press alone, and have brought judgment upon all people; and none were with me;</p>

    <h2 id="section-134" class="chapter-title">Section 134</h2>
    <p id="section-134_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>We believe that religion is instituted of God; and that men are amenable to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious opinions prompt them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others; but we do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments; and that sedition and rebellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished accordingly; and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men owe respect and deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted for the express purpose of regulating our interests as individuals and nations, between man and man; and divine laws given of heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both to be answered by man to his Maker.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are bound to enact laws for the protection of all citizens in the free exercise of their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right in justice to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions, so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws and such religious opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that government in which the offense is committed; and for the public peace and tranquility all men should step forward and use their ability in bringing offenders against good laws to punishment.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil government, whereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed in its spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citizens, denied.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>We believe that all religious societies have a right to deal with their members for disorderly conduct, according to the rules and regulations of such societies; provided that such dealings be for fellowship and good standing; but we do not believe that any religious society has authority to try men on the right of property or life, to take from them this world’s goods, or to put them in jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any physical punishment upon them. They can only excommunicate them from their society, and withdraw from them their fellowship.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>We believe that men should appeal to the civil law for redress of all wrongs and grievances, where personal abuse is inflicted or the right of property or character infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same; but we believe that all men are justified in defending themselves, their friends, and property, and the government, from the unlawful assaults and encroachments of all persons in times of exigency, where immediate appeal cannot be made to the laws, and relief afforded.</p>
    <p id="section-134_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world; but we do not believe it right to interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor to meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men; such interference we believe to be unlawful and unjust, and dangerous to the peace of every government allowing human beings to be held in servitude.</p>

    <h2 id="section-135" class="chapter-title">Section 135</h2>
    <p id="section-135_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>To seal the testimony of this book and the Book of Mormon, we announce the martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Hyrum Smith the Patriarch. They were shot in Carthage jail, on the 27th of June, 1844, about five o’clock p.m., by an armed mob—painted black—of from 150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was shot first and fell calmly, exclaiming: <em>I am a dead man!</em> Joseph leaped from the window, and was shot dead in the attempt, exclaiming: <em>O Lord my God!</em> They were both shot after they were dead, in a brutal manner, and both received four balls.</p>
    <p id="section-135_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the Twelve, were the only persons in the room at the time; the former was wounded in a savage manner with four balls, but has since recovered; the latter, through the providence of God, escaped, without even a hole in his robe.</p>
    <p id="section-135_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord’s anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in death they were not separated!</p>
    <p id="section-135_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said: “I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer’s morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. <span class="small-caps">I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me—he was murdered in cold blood</span>.”—The same morning, after Hyrum had made ready to go—shall it be said to the slaughter? yes, for so it was—he read the following paragraph, near the close of the twelfth chapter of Ether, in the Book of Mormon, and turned down the leaf upon it:</p>
    <p id="section-135_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span><em>And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father. And now I … bid farewell unto the Gentiles; yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood.</em> The testators are now dead, and their testament is in force.</p>
    <p id="section-135_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old in February, 1844, and Joseph Smith was thirty-eight in December, 1843; and henceforward their names will be classed among the martyrs of religion; and the reader in every nation will be reminded that the Book of Mormon, and this book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century to bring them forth for the salvation of a ruined world; and that if the fire can scathe a green tree for the glory of God, how easy it will burn up the dry trees to purify the vineyard of corruption. They lived for glory; they died for glory; and glory is their eternal reward. From age to age shall their names go down to posterity as gems for the sanctified.</p>
    <p id="section-135_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>They were innocent of any crime, as they had often been proved before, and were only confined in jail by the conspiracy of traitors and wicked men; and their <em>innocent blood</em> on the floor of Carthage jail is a broad seal affixed to “Mormonism” that cannot be rejected by any court on earth, and their <em>innocent blood</em> on the escutcheon of the State of Illinois, with the broken faith of the State as pledged by the governor, is a witness to the truth of the everlasting gospel that all the world cannot impeach; and their <em>innocent blood</em> on the banner of liberty, and on the <i>magna charta</i> of the United States, is an ambassador for the religion of Jesus Christ, that will touch the hearts of honest men among all nations; and their <em>innocent blood,</em> with the innocent blood of all the martyrs under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts till he avenges that blood on the earth. Amen.</p>

    <p id="section-136_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Let each company, with their captains and presidents, decide how many can go next spring; then choose out a sufficient number of able-bodied and expert men, to take teams, seeds, and farming utensils, to go as pioneers to prepare for putting in spring crops.</p>
    <p id="section-136_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Let each company bear an equal proportion, according to the dividend of their property, in taking the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the families of those who have gone into the army, that the cries of the widow and the fatherless come not up into the ears of the Lord against this people.</p>
    <p id="section-136_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Let each company prepare houses, and fields for raising grain, for those who are to remain behind this season; and this is the will of the Lord concerning his people.</p>
    <p id="section-136_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Let every man use all his influence and property to remove this people to the place where the Lord shall locate a stake of Zion.</p>
    <p id="section-136_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And if ye do this with a pure heart, in all faithfulness, ye shall be blessed; you shall be blessed in your flocks, and in your herds, and in your fields, and in your houses, and in your families.</p>
    <p id="section-136_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Let my servants Ezra T. Benson and Erastus Snow organize a company.</p>

    <p id="section-137_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>The heavens were opened upon us, and I beheld the celestial kingdom of God, and the glory thereof, whether in the body or out I cannot tell.</p>
    <p id="section-137_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>I saw the transcendent beauty of the gate through which the heirs of that kingdom will enter, which was like unto circling flames of fire;</p>
    <p id="section-137_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Also the blazing throne of God, whereon was seated the Father and the Son.</p>
    <p id="section-137_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>I saw the beautiful streets of that kingdom, which had the appearance of being paved with gold.</p>
    <p id="section-137_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>I saw Father Adam and Abraham; and my father and my mother; my brother Alvin, that has long since slept;</p>
    <p id="section-137_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And marveled how it was that he had obtained an inheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life before the Lord had set his hand to gather Israel the second time, and had not been baptized for the remission of sins.</p>
    <p id="section-137_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Thus came the voice of the Lord unto me, saying: All who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God;</p>
    <p id="section-137_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom;</p>
    <p id="section-137_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.</p>
    <p id="section-137_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And I also beheld that all children who die before they arrive at the years of accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven.</p>

    <h2 id="section-138" class="chapter-title">Section 138</h2>
    <p id="section-138_v1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the world;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>That through his atonement, and by obedience to the principles of the gospel, mankind might be saved.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>While I was thus engaged, my mind reverted to the writings of the apostle Peter, to the primitive saints scattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and other parts of Asia, where the gospel had been preached after the crucifixion of the Lord.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>I opened the Bible and read the third and fourth chapters of the first epistle of Peter, and as I read I was greatly impressed, more than I had ever been before, with the following passages:</p>
    <p id="section-138_v7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>“For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
    <p id="section-138_v8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>“By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>“Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.” (1 Peter 3:18–20.)</p>
    <p id="section-138_v10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>“For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.” (1 Peter 4:6.)</p>
    <p id="section-138_v11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And who had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God, and had suffered tribulation in their Redeemer’s name.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>All these had departed the mortal life, firm in the hope of a glorious resurrection, through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>I beheld that they were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame, bone to his bone, and the sinews and the flesh upon them, the spirit and the body to be united never again to be divided, that they might receive a fulness of joy.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>While this vast multitude waited and conversed, rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared, declaring liberty to the captives who had been faithful;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And there he preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of the resurrection and the redemption of mankind from the fall, and from individual sins on conditions of repentance.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But unto the wicked he did not go, and among the ungodly and the unrepentant who had defiled themselves while in the flesh, his voice was not raised;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Neither did the rebellious who rejected the testimonies and the warnings of the ancient prophets behold his presence, nor look upon his face.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Where these were, darkness reigned, but among the righteous there was peace;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And the saints rejoiced in their redemption, and bowed the knee and acknowledged the Son of God as their Redeemer and Deliverer from death and the chains of hell.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Their countenances shone, and the radiance from the presence of the Lord rested upon them, and they sang praises unto his holy name.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>I marveled, for I understood that the Savior spent about three years in his ministry among the Jews and those of the house of Israel, endeavoring to teach them the everlasting gospel and call them unto repentance;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And yet, notwithstanding his mighty works, and miracles, and proclamation of the truth, in great power and authority, there were but few who hearkened to his voice, and rejoiced in his presence, and received salvation at his hands.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>But his ministry among those who were dead was limited to the brief time intervening between the crucifixion and his resurrection;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And I wondered at the words of Peter—wherein he said that the Son of God preached unto the spirits in prison, who sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah—and how it was possible for him to preach to those spirits and perform the necessary labor among them in so short a time.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And as I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened, and I perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>But behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And the chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of the Lord and proclaim liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto all who would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Thus was the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins, without a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands,</p>
    <p id="section-138_v34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And all other principles of the gospel that were necessary for them to know in order to qualify themselves that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And so it was made known among the dead, both small and great, the unrighteous as well as the faithful, that redemption had been wrought through the sacrifice of the Son of God upon the cross.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Thus was it made known that our Redeemer spent his time during his sojourn in the world of spirits, instructing and preparing the faithful spirits of the prophets who had testified of him in the flesh;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>That they might carry the message of redemption unto all the dead, unto whom he could not go personally, because of their rebellion and transgression, that they through the ministration of his servants might also hear his words.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Among the great and mighty ones who were assembled in this vast congregation of the righteous were Father Adam, the Ancient of Days and father of all,</p>
    <p id="section-138_v39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And our glorious Mother Eve, with many of her faithful daughters who had lived through the ages and worshiped the true and living God.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>Abel, the first martyr, was there, and his brother Seth, one of the mighty ones, who was in the express image of his father, Adam.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Noah, who gave warning of the flood; Shem, the great high priest; Abraham, the father of the faithful; Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, the great law-giver of Israel;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And Isaiah, who declared by prophecy that the Redeemer was anointed to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that were bound, were also there.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>Moreover, Ezekiel, who was shown in vision the great valley of dry bones, which were to be clothed upon with flesh, to come forth again in the resurrection of the dead, living souls;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>Daniel, who foresaw and foretold the establishment of the kingdom of God in the latter days, never again to be destroyed nor given to other people;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Elias, who was with Moses on the Mount of Transfiguration;</p>
    <p id="section-138_v46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And Malachi, the prophet who testified of the coming of Elijah—of whom also Moroni spake to the Prophet Joseph Smith, declaring that he should come before the ushering in of the great and dreadful day of the Lord—were also there.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>The Prophet Elijah was to plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to their fathers,</p>
    <p id="section-138_v48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>Foreshadowing the great work to be done in the temples of the Lord in the dispensation of the fulness of times, for the redemption of the dead, and the sealing of the children to their parents, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse and utterly wasted at his coming.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>All these and many more, even the prophets who dwelt among the Nephites and testified of the coming of the Son of God, mingled in the vast assembly and waited for their deliverance,</p>
    <p id="section-138_v50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>For the dead had looked upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>These the Lord taught, and gave them power to come forth, after his resurrection from the dead, to enter into his Father’s kingdom, there to be crowned with immortality and eternal life,</p>
    <p id="section-138_v52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And continue thenceforth their labor as had been promised by the Lord, and be partakers of all blessings which were held in reserve for them that love him.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>The Prophet Joseph Smith, and my father, Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and other choice spirits who were reserved to come forth in the fulness of times to take part in laying the foundations of the great latter-day work,</p>
    <p id="section-138_v54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>Including the building of the temples and the performance of ordinances therein for the redemption of the dead, were also in the spirit world.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>I observed that they were also among the noble and great ones who were chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church of God.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>Even before they were born, they, with many others, received their first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>I beheld that the faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>The dead who repent will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordinances of the house of God,</p>
    <p id="section-138_v59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>And after they have paid the penalty of their transgressions, and are washed clean, shall receive a reward according to their works, for they are heirs of salvation.</p>
    <p id="section-138_v60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>Thus was the vision of the redemption of the dead revealed to me, and I bear record, and I know that this record is true, through the blessing of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, even so. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="official-declaration-1" class="chapter-title">Official Declaration 1</h2>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p1" class="paragraph">To Whom It May Concern:</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p2" class="paragraph">Press dispatches having been sent for political purposes, from Salt Lake City, which have been widely published, to the effect that the Utah Commission, in their recent report to the Secretary of the Interior, allege that plural marriages are still being solemnized and that forty or more such marriages have been contracted in Utah since last June or during the past year, also that in public discourses the leaders of the Church have taught, encouraged and urged the continuance of the practice of polygamy—</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p3" class="paragraph">I, therefore, as President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, do hereby, in the most solemn manner, declare that these charges are false. We are not teaching polygamy or plural marriage, nor permitting any person to enter into its practice, and I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any other place in the Territory.</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p4" class="paragraph">One case has been reported, in which the parties allege that the marriage was performed in the Endowment House, in Salt Lake City, in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who performed the ceremony; whatever was done in this matter was without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence the Endowment House was, by my instructions, taken down without delay.</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p5" class="paragraph">Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p6" class="paragraph">There is nothing in my teachings to the Church or in those of my associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably construed to inculcate or encourage polygamy; and when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey any such teaching, he has been promptly reproved. And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p7" class="paragraph">Wilford Woodruff</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p8" class="paragraph">President of The Church of Jesus Christ <br/>
    of Latter-day Saints.</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p9" class="paragraph">President Lorenzo Snow offered the following:</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p10" class="paragraph">“I move that, recognizing Wilford Woodruff as the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the only man on the earth at the present time who holds the keys of the sealing ordinances, we consider him fully authorized by virtue of his position to issue the Manifesto which has been read in our hearing, and which is dated September 24th, 1890, and that as a Church in General Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning plural marriages as authoritative and binding.”</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p11" class="paragraph">Salt Lake City, Utah, October 6, 1890.</p>
    
    <h3 id="official-declaration-1_st1" class="section-title">Excerpts from Three Addresses by President Wilford Woodruff Regarding the Manifesto</h3>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p12" class="paragraph">The Lord will never permit me or any other man who stands as President of this Church to lead you astray. It is not in the programme. It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that, the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so He will any other man who attempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty. (Sixty-first Semiannual General Conference of the Church, Monday, October 6, 1890, Salt Lake City, Utah. Reported in <i>Deseret Evening News,</i> October 11, 1890, p. 2.)</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p13" class="paragraph">It matters not who lives or who dies, or who is called to lead this Church, they have got to lead it by the inspiration of Almighty God. If they do not do it that way, they cannot do it at all. …</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p14" class="paragraph">I have had some revelations of late, and very important ones to me, and I will tell you what the Lord has said to me. Let me bring your minds to what is termed the manifesto. …</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p15" class="paragraph">The Lord has told me to ask the Latter-day Saints a question, and He also told me that if they would listen to what I said to them and answer the question put to them, by the Spirit and power of God, they would all answer alike, and they would all believe alike with regard to this matter.</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p16" class="paragraph">The question is this: Which is the wisest course for the Latter-day Saints to pursue—to continue to attempt to practice plural marriage, with the laws of the nation against it and the opposition of sixty millions of people, and at the cost of the confiscation and loss of all the Temples, and the stopping of all the ordinances therein, both for the living and the dead, and the imprisonment of the First Presidency and Twelve and the heads of families in the Church, and the confiscation of personal property of the people (all of which of themselves would stop the practice); or, after doing and suffering what we have through our adherence to this principle to cease the practice and submit to the law, and through doing so leave the Prophets, Apostles and fathers at home, so that they can instruct the people and attend to the duties of the Church, and also leave the Temples in the hands of the Saints, so that they can attend to the ordinances of the Gospel, both for the living and the dead?</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p17" class="paragraph">The Lord showed me by vision and revelation exactly what would take place if we did not stop this practice. If we had not stopped it, you would have had no use for … any of the men in this temple at Logan; for all ordinances would be stopped throughout the land of Zion. Confusion would reign throughout Israel, and many men would be made prisoners. This trouble would have come upon the whole Church, and we should have been compelled to stop the practice. Now, the question is, whether it should be stopped in this manner, or in the way the Lord has manifested to us, and leave our Prophets and Apostles and fathers free men, and the temples in the hands of the people, so that the dead may be redeemed. A large number has already been delivered from the prison house in the spirit world by this people, and shall the work go on or stop? This is the question I lay before the Latter-day Saints. You have to judge for yourselves. I want you to answer it for yourselves. I shall not answer it; but I say to you that that is exactly the condition we as a people would have been in had we not taken the course we have.</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p18" class="paragraph">… I saw exactly what would come to pass if there was not something done. I have had this spirit upon me for a long time. But I want to say this: I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I did do; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me. I went before the Lord, and I wrote what the Lord told me to write. …</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p19" class="paragraph">I leave this with you, for you to contemplate and consider. The Lord is at work with us. (Cache Stake Conference, Logan, Utah, Sunday, November 1, 1891. Reported in <i>Deseret Weekly,</i> November 14, 1891.)</p>
    <p id="official-declaration-1_p20" class="paragraph">Now I will tell you what was manifested to me and what the Son of God performed in this thing. … All these things would have come to pass, as God Almighty lives, had not that Manifesto been given. Therefore, the Son of God felt disposed to have that thing presented to the Church and to the world for purposes in his own mind. The Lord had decreed the establishment of Zion. He had decreed the finishing of this temple. He had decreed that the salvation of the living and the dead should be given in these valleys of the mountains. And Almighty God decreed that the Devil should not thwart it. If you can understand that, that is a key to it. (From a discourse at the sixth session of the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple, April 1893. Typescript of Dedicatory Services, Archives, Church Historical Department, Salt Lake City, Utah.)</p>
