    <p id="matthew-1_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="matthew-1_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Then Joseph her husband, being a just <span class="clarity-word">man,</span> and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</p>
    <p id="matthew-1_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="matthew-1_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name <span class="uppercase">Jesus</span>: for he shall save his people from their sins.</p>
    <p id="matthew-1_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</p>

    <p id="matthew-1_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</p>
    <p id="matthew-1_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name <span class="uppercase">Jesus</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="matthew-2" class="chapter-title">Chapter 2</h2>
    <p id="matthew-2_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>When Herod the king had heard <span class="clarity-word">these things,</span> he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is written by the prophet,</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And thou Bethlehem, <span class="clarity-word">in</span> the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>¶ And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>¶ Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping <span class="clarity-word">for</span> her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s life.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judæa in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</p>
    <p id="matthew-2_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</p>

    <h2 id="matthew-3" class="chapter-title">Chapter 3</h2>
    <p id="matthew-3_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judæa,</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judæa, and all the region round about Jordan,</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>¶ But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to <span class="clarity-word">our</span> father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and <span class="clarity-word">with</span> fire:</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Whose fan <span class="clarity-word">is</span> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>¶ Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer <span class="clarity-word">it to be so</span> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p>
    <p id="matthew-3_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>

    <h2 id="matthew-4" class="chapter-title">Chapter 4</h2>
    <p id="matthew-4_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in <span class="clarity-word">their</span> hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>¶ Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</p>

    <p id="matthew-4_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>¶ From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>¶ And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And they straightway left <span class="clarity-word">their</span> nets, and followed him.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James <span class="clarity-word">the son</span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</p>
    <p id="matthew-4_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</p>

    <p id="matthew-13_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And when he sowed, some <span class="clarity-word">seeds</span> fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p>

    <p id="matthew-13_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</p>

    <p id="matthew-13_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>¶ Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <span class="clarity-word">it</span> not, then cometh the wicked <span class="clarity-word">one,</span> and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth <span class="clarity-word">it;</span> which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>¶ Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>¶ Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>¶ Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked <span class="clarity-word">one;</span></p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</p>

    <p id="matthew-13_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe <span class="clarity-word">which is</span> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <span class="clarity-word">that is</span> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <span class="clarity-word">things</span> new and old.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>¶ And it came to pass, <span class="clarity-word">that</span> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this <span class="clarity-word">man</span> this wisdom, and <span class="clarity-word">these</span> mighty works?</p>
    <p id="matthew-13_p55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</p>

    <p id="matthew-22_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>But they made light of <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</p>

    <p id="matthew-22_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</p>

    <p id="matthew-26_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <span class="clarity-word">wilt.</span></p>
    <p id="matthew-26_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>
    <p id="matthew-26_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <span class="clarity-word">is</span> willing, but the flesh <span class="clarity-word">is</span> weak.</p>

    <p id="matthew-26_p57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>¶ And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <span class="clarity-word">him</span> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
    <p id="matthew-26_p58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
    <p id="matthew-26_p59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>

    <p id="matthew-26_p63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
    <p id="matthew-26_p64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>

    <p id="matthew-26_p67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote <span class="clarity-word">him</span> with the palms of their hands,</p>
    <p id="matthew-26_p68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>
    <p id="matthew-26_p69" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69 </span>¶ Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>

    <p id="matthew-26_p72" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72 </span>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>

    <p id="matthew-26_p74" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74 </span>Then began he to curse and to swear, <span class="clarity-word">saying,</span> I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>

    <p id="matthew-27_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>¶ Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</p>

    <p id="matthew-27_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</p>

    <p id="matthew-27_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</p>

    <p id="matthew-27_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood <span class="clarity-word">be</span> on us, and on our children.</p>

    <p id="matthew-27_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band <span class="clarity-word">of soldiers.</span></p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</p>

    <p id="matthew-27_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify <span class="clarity-word">him.</span></p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</p>

    <p id="matthew-27_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And sitting down they watched him there;</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And set up over his head his accusation written, <span class="uppercase">This Is Jesus the King of the Jews</span>.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>¶ And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</p>

    <p id="matthew-27_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Likewise also the chief priests mocking <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> with the scribes and elders, said,</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Some of them that stood there, when they heard <span class="clarity-word">that,</span> said, This <span class="clarity-word">man</span> calleth for Elias.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled <span class="clarity-word">it</span> with vinegar, and put <span class="clarity-word">it</span> on a reed, and gave him to drink.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>¶ Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathæa, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>¶ Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make <span class="clarity-word">it</span> as sure as ye can.</p>
    <p id="matthew-27_p66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</p>

    <p id="matthew-28_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <span class="clarity-word">away</span> while we slept.</p>

    <h2 id="mark-1" class="chapter-title">Chapter 1</h2>
    <p id="mark-1_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And there went out unto him all the land of Judæa, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And there came a voice from heaven, <span class="clarity-word">saying,</span> Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the <span class="clarity-word">son</span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Saying, Let <span class="clarity-word">us</span> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine <span class="clarity-word">is</span> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All <span class="clarity-word">men</span> seek for thee.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <span class="clarity-word">his</span> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
    <p id="mark-1_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>But he went out, and began to publish <span class="clarity-word">it</span> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p>

    <h2 id="mark-2" class="chapter-title">Chapter 2</h2>
    <p id="mark-2_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And again he entered into Capernaum after <span class="clarity-word">some</span> days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive <span class="clarity-word">them,</span> no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken <span class="clarity-word">it</span> up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Why doth this <span class="clarity-word">man</span> thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, <span class="clarity-word">Thy</span> sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</p>

    <p id="mark-2_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the <span class="clarity-word">son</span> of Alphæus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>When Jesus heard <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p>

    <p id="mark-2_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</p>
    <p id="mark-2_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</p>

    <p id="mark-3_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p>
    <p id="mark-3_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judæa,</p>

    <p id="mark-5_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</p>

    <p id="mark-5_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>For he said unto him, Come out of the man, <span class="clarity-word">thou</span> unclean spirit.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And he asked him, What <span class="clarity-word">is</span> thy name? And he answered, saying, My name <span class="clarity-word">is</span> Legion: for we are many.</p>

    <p id="mark-5_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And they that saw <span class="clarity-word">it</span> told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and <span class="clarity-word">also</span> concerning the swine.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</p>

    <p id="mark-5_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</p>

    <p id="mark-5_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</p>

    <p id="mark-5_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in <span class="clarity-word">her</span> body that she was healed of that plague.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s <span class="clarity-word">house certain</span> which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</p>
    <p id="mark-5_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</p>

    <p id="mark-6_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</p>
    <p id="mark-6_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</p>
    <p id="mark-6_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</p>
    <p id="mark-6_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</p>

    <p id="mark-7_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="mark-7_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</p>

    <p id="mark-7_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</p>
    <p id="mark-7_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with <span class="clarity-word">their</span> lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>

    <p id="mark-8_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <span class="clarity-word">of</span> the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</p>
    <p id="mark-8_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</p>

    <p id="mark-12_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see <span class="clarity-word">it.</span></p>

    <p id="mark-12_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>¶ Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</p>
    <p id="mark-12_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave <span class="clarity-word">his</span> wife <span class="clarity-word">behind him,</span> and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
    <p id="mark-12_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</p>

    <p id="mark-12_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</p>
    <p id="mark-12_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</p>
    <p id="mark-12_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</p>
    <p id="mark-12_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</p>

    <p id="mark-12_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</p>
    <p id="mark-12_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>¶ And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</p>
    <p id="mark-12_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments <span class="clarity-word">is,</span> Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</p>

    <p id="mark-12_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And the second <span class="clarity-word">is</span> like, <span class="clarity-word">namely</span> this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</p>
    <p id="mark-12_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</p>

    <p id="mark-12_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him <span class="clarity-word">any question.</span></p>

    <p id="mark-14_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p>
    <p id="mark-14_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and <span class="clarity-word">with</span> staves to take me?</p>

    <p id="mark-14_p60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what <span class="clarity-word">is it which</span> these witness against thee?</p>

    <p id="mark-14_p65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</p>
    <p id="mark-14_p66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>¶ And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</p>

    <p id="mark-15_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest <span class="clarity-word">it</span><span class="clarity-word">.</span></p>

    <p id="luke-1_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>¶ There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judæa, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife <span class="clarity-word">was</span> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <span class="clarity-word">was</span> Elisabeth.</p>

    <p id="luke-1_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</p>

    <p id="luke-1_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And when Zacharias saw <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</p>

    <p id="luke-1_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</p>

    <p id="luke-1_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And when she saw <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name <span class="uppercase">Jesus</span>.</p>

    <p id="luke-1_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</p>
    <p id="luke-1_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p>

    <p id="luke-2_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>(<span class="clarity-word">And</span> this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</p>

    <p id="luke-2_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.</p>

    <p id="luke-2_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</p>

    <p id="luke-2_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;</p>

    <p id="luke-2_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</p>

    <p id="luke-2_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</p>
    <p id="luke-2_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?</p>

    <p id="luke-3_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</p>

    <p id="luke-4_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.</p>

    <p id="luke-4_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.</p>
    <p id="luke-4_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>But he passing through the midst of them went his way,</p>
    <p id="luke-4_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.</p>

    <p id="luke-4_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.</p>

    <p id="luke-4_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</p>
    <p id="luke-4_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>¶ Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</p>
    <p id="luke-4_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking <span class="clarity-word">them</span> suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</p>
    <p id="luke-4_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.</p>
    <p id="luke-4_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</p>
    <p id="luke-4_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</p>

    <p id="luke-5_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing <span class="clarity-word">their</span> nets.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And they beckoned unto <span class="clarity-word">their</span> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>When Simon Peter saw <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And so <span class="clarity-word">was</span> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>¶ And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <span class="clarity-word">his</span> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And he put forth <span class="clarity-word">his</span> hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</p>

    <p id="luke-5_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>¶ And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judæa, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was <span class="clarity-word">present</span> to heal them.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>¶ And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought <span class="clarity-word">means</span> to bring him in, and to lay <span class="clarity-word">him</span> before him.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And when they could not find by what <span class="clarity-word">way</span> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with <span class="clarity-word">his</span> couch into the midst before Jesus.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</p>

    <p id="luke-5_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>¶ And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</p>

    <p id="luke-5_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</p>

    <p id="luke-5_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
    <p id="luke-5_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>¶ And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise <span class="clarity-word">the disciples</span> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</p>

    <p id="luke-6_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy <span class="clarity-word">it?</span></p>
    <p id="luke-6_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>¶ And when it was day, he called <span class="clarity-word">unto him</span> his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</p>

    <p id="luke-6_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>¶ And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judæa and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed <span class="clarity-word">them</span> all.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>¶ And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed <span class="clarity-word">be ye</span> poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Blessed <span class="clarity-word">are ye</span> that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed <span class="clarity-word">are ye</span> that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</p>

    <p id="luke-6_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And unto him that smiteth thee on the <span class="clarity-word">one</span> cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not <span class="clarity-word">to take thy</span> coat also.</p>
    <p id="luke-6_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask <span class="clarity-word">them</span> not again.</p>

    <h2 id="luke-7" class="chapter-title">Chapter 7</h2>
    <p id="luke-7_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <span class="clarity-word">it.</span></p>
    <p id="luke-7_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>¶ And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <span class="clarity-word">him</span> stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judæa, and throughout all the region round about.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ And John calling <span class="clarity-word">unto him</span> two of his disciples sent <span class="clarity-word">them</span> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And in that same hour he cured many of <span class="clarity-word">their</span> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <span class="clarity-word">that were</span> blind he gave sight.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And blessed is <span class="clarity-word">he,</span> whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>¶ And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>This is <span class="clarity-word">he,</span> of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And all the people that heard <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>¶ And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</p>

    <p id="luke-7_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <span class="clarity-word">Jesus</span> sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And stood at his feet behind <span class="clarity-word">him</span> weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe <span class="clarity-word">them</span> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <span class="clarity-word">them</span> with the ointment.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <span class="clarity-word">this is</span> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>Simon answered and said, I suppose that <span class="clarity-word">he,</span> to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <span class="clarity-word">them</span> with the hairs of her head.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <span class="clarity-word">the same</span> loveth little.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>
    <p id="luke-7_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p>

    <h2 id="luke-8" class="chapter-title">Chapter 8</h2>
    <p id="luke-8_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve <span class="clarity-word">were</span> with him,</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>¶ And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</p>

    <p id="luke-8_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>¶ Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled <span class="clarity-word">with water,</span> and were in jeopardy.</p>

    <p id="luke-8_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>¶ And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in <span class="clarity-word">any</span> house, but in the tombs.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, <span class="clarity-word">thou</span> Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.

    <p id="luke-8_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</p>

    <p id="luke-8_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>When they that fed <span class="clarity-word">them</span> saw what was done, they fled, and went and told <span class="clarity-word">it</span> in the city and in the country.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>They also which saw <span class="clarity-word">it</span> told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>¶ Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</p>

    <p id="luke-8_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people <span class="clarity-word">gladly</span> received him: for they were all waiting for him.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>¶ And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>¶ And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>Came behind <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press <span class="clarity-word">thee,</span> and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>¶ While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s <span class="clarity-word">house,</span> saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>But when Jesus heard <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.</p>
    <p id="luke-8_p56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.</p>

    <p id="luke-9_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And he said unto them, Take nothing for <span class="clarity-word">your</span> journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>¶ Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>¶ And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And the people, when they knew <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>¶ And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>They answering said, John the Baptist; but some <span class="clarity-word">say,</span> Elias; and others <span class="clarity-word">say,</span> that one of the old prophets is risen again.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And he straitly charged them, and commanded <span class="clarity-word">them</span> to tell no man that thing;</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>¶ And he said to <span class="clarity-word">them</span> all, If any <span class="clarity-word">man</span> will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and <span class="clarity-word">in his</span> Father’s, and of the holy angels.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>¶ And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment <span class="clarity-word">was</span> white <span class="clarity-word">and</span> glistering.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept <span class="clarity-word">it</span> close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>¶ And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare <span class="clarity-word">him.</span> And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>¶ And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>¶ Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>¶ And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And Jesus said unto him, Forbid <span class="clarity-word">him</span> not: for he that is not against us is for us.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>¶ And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>And when his disciples James and John saw <span class="clarity-word">this,</span> they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save <span class="clarity-word">them.</span> And they went to another village.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>¶ And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain <span class="clarity-word">man</span> said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air <span class="clarity-word">have</span> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay <span class="clarity-word">his</span> head.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</p>
    <p id="luke-9_p62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</p>

    <p id="luke-18_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</p>
    <p id="luke-18_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</p>

    <p id="luke-19_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And <span class="clarity-word">Jesus</span> entered and passed through Jericho.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And, behold, <span class="clarity-word">there was</span> a man named Zacchæus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that <span class="clarity-word">way.</span></p>
    <p id="luke-19_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchæus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And when they saw <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And Zacchæus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore <span class="clarity-word">him</span> fourfold.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this <span class="clarity-word">man</span> to reign over us.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And another came, saying, Lord, behold, <span class="clarity-word">here is</span> thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, <span class="clarity-word">thou</span> wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give <span class="clarity-word">it</span> to him that hath ten pounds.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay <span class="clarity-word">them</span> before me.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>¶ And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called <span class="clarity-word">the mount</span> of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Saying, Go ye into the village over against <span class="clarity-word">you;</span> in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring <span class="clarity-word">him hither.</span></p>
    <p id="luke-19_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose <span class="clarity-word">him?</span> thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Saying, Blessed <span class="clarity-word">be</span> the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>¶ And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things <span class="clarity-word">which belong</span> unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</p>
    <p id="luke-19_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</p>

    <p id="luke-20_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And it came to pass, <span class="clarity-word">that</span> on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon <span class="clarity-word">him</span> with the elders,</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And they answered, that they could not tell whence <span class="clarity-word">it was.</span></p>
    <p id="luke-20_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent <span class="clarity-word">him</span> away empty.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated <span class="clarity-word">him</span> shamefully, and sent <span class="clarity-word">him</span> away empty.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast <span class="clarity-word">him</span> out.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence <span class="clarity-word">him</span> when they see him.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed <span class="clarity-word">him.</span> What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> they said, God forbid.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And they watched <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person <span class="clarity-word">of any,</span> but teachest the way of God truly:</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Cæsar, or no?</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Cæsar’s.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which be Cæsar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>¶ Then came to <span class="clarity-word">him</span> certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Last of all the woman died also.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>¶ Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And after that they durst not ask him any <span class="clarity-word">question at all.</span></p>
    <p id="luke-20_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p>

    <p id="luke-20_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>¶ Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</p>
    <p id="luke-20_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</p>

    <p id="luke-21_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.</p>
    <p id="luke-21_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:</p>
    <p id="luke-21_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.</p>
    <p id="luke-21_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>¶ And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,</p>

    <p id="luke-22_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>¶ Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>¶ Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide <span class="clarity-word">it</span> among yourselves:</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup <span class="clarity-word">is</span> the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>¶ But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me <span class="clarity-word">is</span> with me on the table.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>¶ And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>But ye <span class="clarity-word">shall</span> not <span class="clarity-word">be</span> so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>For whether <span class="clarity-word">is</span> greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? <span class="clarity-word">is</span> not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>¶ And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired <span class="clarity-word">to have</span> you, that he may sift <span class="clarity-word">you</span> as wheat:</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> and likewise <span class="clarity-word">his</span> scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And they said, Lord, behold, here <span class="clarity-word">are</span> two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>¶ And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>¶ And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>¶ And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>¶ Then took they him, and led <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this <span class="clarity-word">fellow</span> also was with him: for he is a Galilæan.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p62" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62 </span>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>¶ And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote <span class="clarity-word">him.</span></p>
    <p id="luke-22_p64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>¶ And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>And if I also ask <span class="clarity-word">you,</span> ye will not answer me, nor let <span class="clarity-word">me</span> go.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p69" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69 </span>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p70" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70 </span>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</p>
    <p id="luke-22_p71" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71 </span>And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</p>

    <h2 id="luke-23" class="chapter-title">Chapter 23</h2>
    <p id="luke-23_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this <span class="clarity-word">fellow</span> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest <span class="clarity-word">it.</span></p>
    <p id="luke-23_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and <span class="clarity-word">to</span> the people, I find no fault in this man.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilæan.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>¶ And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <span class="clarity-word">season,</span> because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>¶ And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>¶ And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <span class="clarity-word">him</span> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>I will therefore chastise him, and release <span class="clarity-word">him.</span></p>
    <p id="luke-23_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this <span class="clarity-word">man,</span> and release unto us Barabbas:</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>But they cried, saying, Crucify <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> crucify him.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let <span class="clarity-word">him</span> go.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <span class="clarity-word">it</span> after Jesus.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>¶ And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <span class="clarity-word">are</span> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>¶ Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p>
    <p id="luke-23_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>

    <p id="luke-24_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now upon the first <span class="clarity-word">day</span> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain <span class="clarity-word">others</span> with them.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And as they were afraid, and bowed down <span class="clarity-word">their</span> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</p>

    <p id="luke-24_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <span class="clarity-word">the mother</span> of James, and other <span class="clarity-word">women that were</span> with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</p>

    <p id="luke-24_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>¶ And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <span class="clarity-word">about</span> threescore furlongs.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And it came to pass, that, while they communed <span class="clarity-word">together</span> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And he said unto them, What manner of communications <span class="clarity-word">are</span> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found <span class="clarity-word">it</span> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> and brake, and gave to them.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And they told what things <span class="clarity-word">were done</span> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>¶ And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace <span class="clarity-word">be</span> unto you.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <span class="clarity-word">his</span> hands and <span class="clarity-word">his</span> feet.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And he took <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> and did eat before them.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And he said unto them, These <span class="clarity-word">are</span> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <span class="clarity-word">in</span> the prophets, and <span class="clarity-word">in</span> the psalms, concerning me.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>¶ And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>¶ And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</p>
    <p id="luke-24_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>

    <p id="john-1_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>¶ There was a man sent from God, whose name <span class="clarity-word">was</span> John.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all <span class="clarity-word">men</span> through him might believe.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>He was not that Light, but <span class="clarity-word">was sent</span> to bear witness of that Light.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span><span class="clarity-word">That</span> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, <span class="clarity-word">even</span> to them that believe on his name:</p>
    <p id="john-1_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>¶ John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For the law was given by Moses, <span class="clarity-word">but</span> grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p id="john-1_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</p>
    <p id="john-1_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</p>
    <p id="john-1_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>He said, I <span class="clarity-word">am</span> the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</p>
    <p id="john-1_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</p>
    <p id="john-1_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>¶ The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>¶ Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</p>
    <p id="john-1_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</p>
    <p id="john-1_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</p>
    <p id="john-1_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>One of the two which heard John <span class="clarity-word">speak,</span> and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>¶ The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</p>
    <p id="john-1_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</p>
    <p id="john-1_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</p>

    <p id="john-3_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</p>
    <p id="john-3_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</p>
    <p id="john-3_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <span class="clarity-word">of</span> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</p>
    <p id="john-3_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</p>
    <p id="john-3_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</p>

    <p id="john-3_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>¶ And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>
    <p id="john-3_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>¶ He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>¶ After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>¶ And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>For John was not yet cast into prison.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>¶ Then there arose a question between <span class="clarity-word">some</span> of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all <span class="clarity-word">men</span> come to him.</p>
    <p id="john-3_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</p>

    <p id="john-3_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</p>

    <p id="john-3_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</p>

    <h2 id="john-4" class="chapter-title">Chapter 4</h2>
    <p id="john-4_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</p>
    <p id="john-4_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</p>
    <p id="john-4_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>He left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And he must needs go through Samaria.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <span class="clarity-word">his</span> journey, sat thus on the well: <span class="clarity-word">and</span> it was about the sixth hour.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</p>

    <p id="john-4_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</p>
    <p id="john-4_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</p>
    <p id="john-4_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</p>
    <p id="john-4_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</p>
    <p id="john-4_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>God <span class="clarity-word">is</span> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship <span class="clarity-word">him</span> in spirit and in truth.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am <span class="clarity-word">he.</span></p>
    <p id="john-4_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>¶ And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</p>
    <p id="john-4_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</p>
    <p id="john-4_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</p>
    <p id="john-4_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <span class="clarity-word">ought</span> to eat?</p>
    <p id="john-4_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <span class="clarity-word">then</span> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And many more believed because of his own word;</p>
    <p id="john-4_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard <span class="clarity-word">him</span> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> saying, Thy son liveth.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>So the father knew that <span class="clarity-word">it was</span> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</p>
    <p id="john-4_p54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>This <span class="clarity-word">is</span> again the second miracle <span class="clarity-word">that</span> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judæa into Galilee.</p>

    <h2 id="john-5" class="chapter-title">Chapter 5</h2>
    <p id="john-5_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="john-5_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <span class="clarity-word">market</span> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</p>
    <p id="john-5_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</p>

    <p id="john-5_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
    <p id="john-5_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</p>

    <p id="john-5_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>

    <p id="john-5_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>

    <p id="john-6_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is <span class="clarity-word">the sea</span> of Tiberias.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>¶ When Jesus then lifted up <span class="clarity-word">his</span> eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</p>
    <p id="john-6_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,</p>
    <p id="john-6_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?</p>
    <p id="john-6_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Therefore they gathered <span class="clarity-word">them</span> together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>¶ When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And when even was <span class="clarity-word">now</span> come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</p>
    <p id="john-6_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>¶ The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but <span class="clarity-word">that</span> his disciples were gone away alone;</p>
    <p id="john-6_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</p>

    <p id="john-6_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</p>
    <p id="john-6_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</p>

    <p id="john-6_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</p>
    <p id="john-6_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</p>

    <p id="john-6_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</p>
    <p id="john-6_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</p>

    <p id="john-6_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>I am that bread of life.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us <span class="clarity-word">his</span> flesh to eat?</p>
    <p id="john-6_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p60" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60 </span>Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard <span class="clarity-word">this,</span> said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</p>
    <p id="john-6_p61" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61 </span>When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?</p>

    <p id="john-6_p63" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63 </span>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, <span class="clarity-word">they</span> are spirit, and <span class="clarity-word">they</span> are life.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p64" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64 </span>But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p65" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65 </span>And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p66" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66 </span>¶ From that <span class="clarity-word">time</span> many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</p>
    <p id="john-6_p67" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67 </span>Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</p>
    <p id="john-6_p68" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68 </span>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</p>

    <p id="john-7_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>
    <p id="john-7_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
    <p id="john-7_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
    <p id="john-7_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this <span class="clarity-word">man</span> hath done?</p>
    <p id="john-7_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>¶ The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</p>
    <p id="john-7_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and <span class="clarity-word">then</span> I go unto him that sent me.</p>

    <p id="john-7_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>

    <p id="john-7_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>In the last day, that great <span class="clarity-word">day</span> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</p>

    <p id="john-8_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</p>
    <p id="john-8_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</p>
    <p id="john-8_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him.

    <p id="john-8_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And they which heard <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> being convicted by <span class="clarity-word">their own</span> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <span class="clarity-word">even</span> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</p>
    <p id="john-8_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, <span class="clarity-word">yet</span> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</p>

    <p id="john-8_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>

    <p id="john-8_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even <span class="clarity-word">the same</span> that I said unto you from the beginning.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</p>

    <p id="john-8_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <span class="clarity-word">he,</span> and <span class="clarity-word">that</span> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, <span class="clarity-word">then</span> are ye my disciples indeed;</p>

    <p id="john-8_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>¶ They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</p>
    <p id="john-8_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <span class="clarity-word">but</span> the Son abideth ever.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <span class="clarity-word">even</span> God.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>Why do ye not understand my speech? <span class="clarity-word">even</span> because ye cannot hear my word.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>Ye are of <span class="clarity-word">your</span> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.

    <p id="john-8_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>And because I tell <span class="clarity-word">you</span> the truth, ye believe me not.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</p>
    <p id="john-8_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear <span class="clarity-word">them</span> not, because ye are not of God.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</p>
    <p id="john-8_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</p>
    <p id="john-8_p54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</p>
    <p id="john-8_p55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> and was glad.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</p>
    <p id="john-8_p58" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58 </span>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</p>
    <p id="john-8_p59" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59 </span>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</p>

    <p id="john-9_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>

    <p id="john-11_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</p>

    <p id="john-11_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</p>

    <p id="john-11_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Then when Jesus came, he found that he had <span class="clarity-word">lain</span> in the grave four days already.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</p>
    <p id="john-11_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat <span class="clarity-word">still</span> in the house.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>

    <p id="john-11_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</p>
    <p id="john-11_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</p>
    <p id="john-11_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>As soon as she heard <span class="clarity-word">that,</span> she arose quickly, and came unto him.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</p>
    <p id="john-11_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Jesus wept.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</p>
    <p id="john-11_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</p>
    <p id="john-11_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been <span class="clarity-word">dead</span> four days.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</p>
    <p id="john-11_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Then they took away the stone <span class="clarity-word">from the place</span> where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up <span class="clarity-word">his</span> eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>¶ Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>If we let him thus alone, all <span class="clarity-word">men</span> will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>And one of them, <span class="clarity-word">named</span> Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</p>
    <p id="john-11_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</p>
    <p id="john-11_p52" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52 </span>And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p53" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53 </span>Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p54" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54 </span>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p55" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55 </span>¶ And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</p>
    <p id="john-11_p56" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56 </span>Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</p>
    <p id="john-11_p57" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57 </span>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> that they might take him.</p>

    <h2 id="john-12" class="chapter-title">Chapter 12</h2>
    <p id="john-12_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</p>
    <p id="john-12_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</p>
    <p id="john-12_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</p>
    <p id="john-12_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <span class="clarity-word">son,</span> which should betray him,</p>

    <p id="john-18_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Judas then, having received a band <span class="clarity-word">of men</span> and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</p>

    <p id="john-18_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>As soon then as he had said unto them, I am <span class="clarity-word">he,</span> they went backward, and fell to the ground.</p>

    <p id="john-18_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</p>
    <p id="john-18_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</p>

    <p id="john-18_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>One of the servants of the high priest, being <span class="clarity-word">his</span> kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</p>

    <p id="john-18_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</p>
    <p id="john-18_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</p>
    <p id="john-18_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</p>

    <p id="john-18_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault <span class="clarity-word">at all.</span></p>

    <p id="john-19_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>But they cried out, Away with <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> away with <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> crucify him.

    <p id="john-19_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led <span class="clarity-word">him</span> away.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called <span class="clarity-word">the place</span> of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</p>
    <p id="john-19_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ And Pilate wrote a title, and put <span class="clarity-word">it</span> on the cross. And the writing was, <span class="uppercase">Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews</span>.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, <span class="clarity-word">and</span> Greek, <span class="clarity-word">and</span> Latin.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>¶ Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also <span class="clarity-word">his</span> coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.

    <p id="john-19_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>¶ Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the <span class="clarity-word">wife</span> of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</p>

    <p id="john-19_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>¶ After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put <span class="clarity-word">it</span> upon hyssop, and put <span class="clarity-word">it</span> to his mouth.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <span class="clarity-word">that</span> they might be taken away.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</p>
    <p id="john-19_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And he that saw <span class="clarity-word">it</span> bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>¶ And after this Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave <span class="clarity-word">him</span> leave.

    <p id="john-19_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound <span class="clarity-word">weight.</span></p>
    <p id="john-19_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</p>
    <p id="john-19_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</p>

    <p id="john-20_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>The first <span class="clarity-word">day</span> of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</p>
    <p id="john-20_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</p>

    <p id="john-20_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And he stooping down, <span class="clarity-word">and looking in,</span> saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</p>

    <p id="john-20_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>¶ But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, <span class="clarity-word">and looked</span> into the sepulchre,</p>

    <p id="john-20_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</p>
    <p id="john-20_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</p>
    <p id="john-20_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and <span class="clarity-word">to</span> my God, and your God.</p>
    <p id="john-20_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and <span class="clarity-word">that</span> he had spoken these things unto her.</p>

    <p id="john-20_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And when he had so said, he shewed unto them <span class="clarity-word">his</span> hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</p>
    <p id="john-20_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Then said Jesus to them again, Peace <span class="clarity-word">be</span> unto you: as <span class="clarity-word">my</span> Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</p>

    <p id="john-20_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>¶ But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</p>
    <p id="john-20_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord.

    <p id="john-20_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>¶ And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: <span class="clarity-word">then</span> came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace <span class="clarity-word">be</span> unto you.</p>
    <p id="john-20_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust <span class="clarity-word">it</span> into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</p>

    <p id="john-21_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he <span class="clarity-word">himself.</span></p>
    <p id="john-21_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <span class="clarity-word">sons</span> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt <span class="clarity-word">his</span> fisher’s coat <span class="clarity-word">unto him,</span> (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Jesus saith unto them, Come <span class="clarity-word">and</span> dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>¶ So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, <span class="clarity-word">son</span> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?

    <p id="john-21_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>He saith to him again the second time, Simon, <span class="clarity-word">son</span> of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>He saith unto him the third time, Simon, <span class="clarity-word">son</span> of Jonas, lovest thou me?

    <p id="john-21_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <span class="clarity-word">thee</span> whither thou wouldest not.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</p>
    <p id="john-21_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <span class="clarity-word">shall</span> this man <span class="clarity-word">do?</span></p>
    <p id="john-21_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <span class="clarity-word">is that</span> to thee? follow thou me.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <span class="clarity-word">is that</span> to thee?</p>
    <p id="john-21_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</p>
    <p id="john-21_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</p>

    <p id="acts-2_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilæans?</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judæa, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>¶ But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judæa, and all <span class="clarity-word">ye</span> that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is <span class="clarity-word">but</span> the third hour of the day.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And it shall come to pass, <span class="clarity-word">that</span> whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Men <span class="clarity-word">and</span> brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>¶ Now when they heard <span class="clarity-word">this,</span> they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men <span class="clarity-word">and</span> brethren, what shall we do?</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, <span class="clarity-word">even</span> as many as the Lord our God shall call.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>¶ Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added <span class="clarity-word">unto them</span> about three thousand souls.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all <span class="clarity-word">men,</span> as every man had need.</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</p>
    <p id="acts-2_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</p>

    <h2 id="acts-3" class="chapter-title">Chapter 3</h2>
    <p id="acts-3_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, <span class="clarity-word">being</span> the ninth <span class="clarity-word">hour.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-3_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted <span class="clarity-word">him</span> up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>¶ And when Peter saw <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let <span class="clarity-word">him</span> go.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> as <span class="clarity-word">did</span> also your rulers.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="acts-3_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;</p>

    <p id="acts-4_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And they laid hands on them, and put <span class="clarity-word">them</span> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <span class="clarity-word">even</span> by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>¶ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them <span class="clarity-word">is</span> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny <span class="clarity-word">it.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-4_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <span class="clarity-word">men</span> glorified God for that which was done.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>¶ And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou <span class="clarity-word">art</span> God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>¶ And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any <span class="clarity-word">of them</span> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</p>
    <p id="acts-4_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And laid <span class="clarity-word">them</span> down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</p>

    <p id="acts-5_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>There came also a multitude <span class="clarity-word">out</span> of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</p>

    <p id="acts-5_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</p>

    <p id="acts-5_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And when they had brought them, they set <span class="clarity-word">them</span> before the council: and the high priest asked them,</p>

    <p id="acts-5_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And we are his witnesses of these things; and <span class="clarity-word">so is</span> also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</p>

    <p id="acts-5_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</p>
    <p id="acts-5_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.</p>
    <p id="acts-5_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</p>
    <p id="acts-5_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, <span class="clarity-word">even</span> as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</p>
    <p id="acts-5_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:</p>

    <p id="acts-5_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten <span class="clarity-word">them,</span> they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</p>
    <p id="acts-5_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>¶ And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</p>

    <p id="acts-7_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Then came he out of the land of the Chaldæans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not <span class="clarity-word">so much as</span> to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when <span class="clarity-word">as yet</span> he had no child.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat <span class="clarity-word">them</span> evil four hundred years.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so <span class="clarity-word">Abraham</span> begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac <span class="clarity-word">begat</span> Jacob; and Jacob <span class="clarity-word">begat</span> the twelve patriarchs.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</p>

    <p id="acts-7_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,</p>

    <p id="acts-7_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.</p>

    <p id="acts-7_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</p>

    <p id="acts-7_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send <span class="clarity-word">to be</span> a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</p>
    <p id="acts-7_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</p>

    <p id="acts-8_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <span class="clarity-word">with them:</span> and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And there was great joy in that city.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Then laid they <span class="clarity-word">their</span> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <span class="clarity-word">in</span> the bond of iniquity.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And Philip ran thither to <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And as they went on <span class="clarity-word">their</span> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <span class="clarity-word">here is</span> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</p>
    <p id="acts-8_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea.</p>

    <h2 id="acts-9" class="chapter-title">Chapter 9</h2>
    <p id="acts-9_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: <span class="clarity-word">it is</span> hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord <span class="clarity-word">said</span> unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought <span class="clarity-word">him</span> into Damascus.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>¶ And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I <span class="clarity-word">am here,</span> Lord.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And the Lord <span class="clarity-word">said</span> unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for <span class="clarity-word">one</span> called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting <span class="clarity-word">his</span> hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, <span class="clarity-word">even</span> Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>But all that heard <span class="clarity-word">him</span> were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>¶ And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Then the disciples took him by night, and let <span class="clarity-word">him</span> down by the wall in a basket.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>But Barnabas took him, and brought <span class="clarity-word">him</span> to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span><span class="clarity-word">Which</span> when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Cæsarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Then had the churches rest throughout all Judæa and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>¶ And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all <span class="clarity-word">quarters,</span> he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And there he found a certain man named Æneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And Peter said unto him, Æneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>¶ Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid <span class="clarity-word">her</span> in an upper chamber.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring <span class="clarity-word">him</span> that he would not delay to come to them.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning <span class="clarity-word">him</span> to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And he gave her <span class="clarity-word">his</span> hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.</p>
    <p id="acts-9_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.</p>

    <h2 id="acts-10" class="chapter-title">Chapter 10</h2>
    <p id="acts-10_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>There was a certain man in Cæsarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian <span class="clarity-word">band,</span></p>

    <p id="acts-10_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And now send men to Joppa, and call for <span class="clarity-word">one</span> Simon, whose surname is Peter:</p>

    <p id="acts-10_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And when he had declared all <span class="clarity-word">these</span> things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>¶ On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And the voice <span class="clarity-word">spake</span> unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, <span class="clarity-word">that</span> call not thou common.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what <span class="clarity-word">is</span> the cause wherefore ye are come?</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Then called he them in, and lodged <span class="clarity-word">them.</span> And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And the morrow after they entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped <span class="clarity-word">him.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-10_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Therefore came I <span class="clarity-word">unto you</span> without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of <span class="clarity-word">one</span> Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</p>
    <p id="acts-10_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</p>

    <p id="acts-10_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>The word which <span class="clarity-word">God</span> sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</p>

    <p id="acts-11_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And the apostles and brethren that were in Judæa heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>But Peter rehearsed <span class="clarity-word">the matter</span> from the beginning, and expounded <span class="clarity-word">it</span> by order unto them, saying,</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, <span class="clarity-word">that</span> call not thou common.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Cæsarea unto me.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</p>

    <p id="acts-11_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as <span class="clarity-word">he did</span> unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.</p>

    <p id="acts-11_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>¶ Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</p>

    <p id="acts-11_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>¶ And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Cæsar.</p>
    <p id="acts-11_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judæa:</p>

    <p id="acts-12_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth <span class="clarity-word">his</span> hands to vex certain of the church.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And when he had apprehended him, he put <span class="clarity-word">him</span> in prison, and delivered <span class="clarity-word">him</span> to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon <span class="clarity-word">him,</span> and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly.

    <p id="acts-12_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and <span class="clarity-word">from</span> all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And when he had considered <span class="clarity-word">the thing,</span> he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened <span class="clarity-word">the door,</span> and saw him, they were astonished.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.

    <p id="acts-12_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that <span class="clarity-word">they</span> should be put to death.

    <p id="acts-12_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>¶ And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s <span class="clarity-word">country.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-12_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And the people gave a shout, <span class="clarity-word">saying, It is</span> the voice of a god, and not of a man.</p>
    <p id="acts-12_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</p>

    <p id="acts-12_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled <span class="clarity-word">their</span> ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p>

    <p id="acts-13_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</p>

    <p id="acts-13_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>¶ So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to <span class="clarity-word">their</span> minister.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name <span class="clarity-word">was</span> Bar-jesus:</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Then Saul, (who also <span class="clarity-word">is called</span> Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,</p>

    <p id="acts-13_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And now, behold, the hand of the Lord <span class="clarity-word">is</span> upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season.

    <p id="acts-13_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>¶ But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, <span class="clarity-word">Ye</span> men <span class="clarity-word">and</span> brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with <span class="clarity-word">his</span> hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And after that he gave <span class="clarity-word">unto them</span> judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the <span class="clarity-word">son</span> of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>Of this man’s seed hath God according to <span class="clarity-word">his</span> promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:</p>

    <p id="acts-13_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am?

    <p id="acts-13_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Men <span class="clarity-word">and</span> brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled <span class="clarity-word">them</span> in condemning <span class="clarity-word">him.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-13_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And though they found no cause of death <span class="clarity-word">in him,</span> yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took <span class="clarity-word">him</span> down from the tree, and laid <span class="clarity-word">him</span> in a sepulchre.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>But God raised him from the dead:</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, <span class="clarity-word">now</span> no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Wherefore he saith also in another <span class="clarity-word">psalm,</span> Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>¶ Be it known unto you therefore, men <span class="clarity-word">and</span> brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>¶ And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p45" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45 </span>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p46" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46 </span>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p47" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47 </span>For so hath the Lord commanded us, <span class="clarity-word">saying,</span> I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p48" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48 </span>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p49" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49 </span>And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p50" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50 </span>But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</p>
    <p id="acts-13_p51" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51 </span>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.</p>

    <p id="acts-14_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use <span class="clarity-word">them</span> despitefully, and to stone them,</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>They were ware of <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And there they preached the gospel.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>¶ And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked:</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>The same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span><span class="clarity-word">Which</span> when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard <span class="clarity-word">of,</span> they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ And there came thither <span class="clarity-word">certain</span> Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew <span class="clarity-word">him</span> out of the city, supposing he had been dead.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and <span class="clarity-word">to</span> Iconium, and Antioch,</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Confirming the souls of the disciples, <span class="clarity-word">and</span> exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.</p>
    <p id="acts-14_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And there they abode long time with the disciples.</p>

    <h2 id="acts-15" class="chapter-title">Chapter 15</h2>
    <p id="acts-15_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And certain men which came down from Judæa taught the brethren, <span class="clarity-word">and said,</span> Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and <span class="clarity-word">of</span> the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command <span class="clarity-word">them</span> to keep the law of Moses.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>¶ And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men <span class="clarity-word">and</span> brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as <span class="clarity-word">he did</span> unto us;</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>¶ Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>¶ And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men <span class="clarity-word">and</span> brethren, hearken unto me:</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and <span class="clarity-word">from</span> fornication, and <span class="clarity-word">from</span> things strangled, and <span class="clarity-word">from</span> blood.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; <span class="clarity-word">namely,</span> Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And they wrote <span class="clarity-word">letters</span> by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren <span class="clarity-word">send</span> greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, <span class="clarity-word">Ye must</span> be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no <span class="clarity-word">such</span> commandment:</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell <span class="clarity-word">you</span> the same things by mouth.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span><span class="clarity-word">Which</span> when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed <span class="clarity-word">them.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-15_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And after they had tarried <span class="clarity-word">there</span> a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>¶ And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, <span class="clarity-word">and see</span> how they do.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-15_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</p>

    <h2 id="acts-16" class="chapter-title">Chapter 16</h2>
    <p id="acts-16_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father <span class="clarity-word">was</span> a Greek:</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next <span class="clarity-word">day</span> to Neapolis;</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, <span class="clarity-word">and</span> a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted <span class="clarity-word">thither.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-16_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>¶ And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard <span class="clarity-word">us:</span> whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought <span class="clarity-word">us,</span> saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide <span class="clarity-word">there.</span> And she constrained us.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>¶ And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>¶ And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew <span class="clarity-word">them</span> into the marketplace unto the rulers,</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat <span class="clarity-word">them.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-16_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast <span class="clarity-word">them</span> into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>¶ And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed <span class="clarity-word">their</span> stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast <span class="clarity-word">us</span> into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And they came and besought them, and brought <span class="clarity-word">them</span> out, and desired <span class="clarity-word">them</span> to depart out of the city.</p>
    <p id="acts-16_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And they went out of the prison, and entered into <span class="clarity-word">the house of</span> Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</p>

    <p id="acts-17_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</p>

    <p id="acts-17_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>¶ And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming <span class="clarity-word">thither</span> went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>¶ Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, <span class="clarity-word">is?</span></p>
    <p id="acts-17_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>¶ Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, <span class="clarity-word">Ye</span> men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, <span class="uppercase">To the Unknown God</span>. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by <span class="clarity-word">that</span> man whom he hath ordained; <span class="clarity-word">whereof</span> he hath given assurance unto all <span class="clarity-word">men,</span> in that he hath raised him from the dead.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>¶ And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this <span class="clarity-word">matter.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-17_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>So Paul departed from among them.</p>
    <p id="acts-17_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which <span class="clarity-word">was</span> Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</p>

    <p id="acts-18_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews <span class="clarity-word">that</span> Jesus <span class="clarity-word">was</span> Christ.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook <span class="clarity-word">his</span> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <span class="clarity-word">be</span> upon your own heads; I <span class="clarity-word">am</span> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>¶ And he departed thence, and entered into a certain <span class="clarity-word">man’s</span> house, named Justus, <span class="clarity-word">one</span> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</p>

    <p id="acts-18_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And he continued <span class="clarity-word">there</span> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>¶ And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</p>

    <p id="acts-18_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And when Paul was now about to open <span class="clarity-word">his</span> mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O <span class="clarity-word">ye</span> Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>But if it be a question of words and names, and <span class="clarity-word">of</span> your law, look ye <span class="clarity-word">to it;</span> for I will be no judge of such <span class="clarity-word">matters.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-18_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And he drave them from the judgment seat.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat <span class="clarity-word">him</span> before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>¶ And Paul <span class="clarity-word">after this</span> tarried <span class="clarity-word">there</span> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <span class="clarity-word">his</span> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</p>

    <p id="acts-18_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And when he had landed at Cæsarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</p>

    <p id="acts-18_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, <span class="clarity-word">and</span> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto <span class="clarity-word">them,</span> and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</p>
    <p id="acts-18_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</p>

    <h2 id="acts-19" class="chapter-title">Chapter 19</h2>
    <p id="acts-19_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>When they heard <span class="clarity-word">this,</span> they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And when Paul had laid <span class="clarity-word">his</span> hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And all the men were about twelve.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>¶ Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And there were seven sons of <span class="clarity-word">one</span> Sceva, a Jew, <span class="clarity-word">and</span> chief of the priests, which did so.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all <span class="clarity-word">men:</span> and they counted the price of them, and found <span class="clarity-word">it</span> fifty thousand <span class="clarity-word">pieces</span> of silver.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>¶ After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>For a certain <span class="clarity-word">man</span> named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And when they heard <span class="clarity-word">these sayings,</span> they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great <span class="clarity-word">is</span> Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring <span class="clarity-word">him</span> that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great <span class="clarity-word">is</span> Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, <span class="clarity-word">Ye</span> men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the <span class="clarity-word">image</span> which fell down from Jupiter?</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</p>
    <p id="acts-19_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</p>

    <p id="acts-23_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</p>
    <p id="acts-23_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>So the chief captain <span class="clarity-word">then</span> let the young man depart, and charged <span class="clarity-word">him, See thou</span> tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</p>
    <p id="acts-23_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And he called unto <span class="clarity-word">him</span> two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Cæsarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</p>
    <p id="acts-23_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And provide <span class="clarity-word">them</span> beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring <span class="clarity-word">him</span> safe unto Felix the governor.</p>

    <p id="acts-23_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</p>
    <p id="acts-23_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</p>

    <p id="acts-23_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought <span class="clarity-word">him</span> by night to Antipatris.</p>

    <p id="acts-24_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</p>
    <p id="acts-24_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>But the chief captain Lysias came <span class="clarity-word">upon us,</span> and with great violence took <span class="clarity-word">him</span> away out of our hands,</p>

    <p id="acts-24_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</p>
    <p id="acts-24_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</p>

    <p id="acts-24_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</p>

    <p id="acts-24_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and <span class="clarity-word">toward</span> men.</p>
    <p id="acts-24_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</p>

    <p id="acts-25_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Cæsarea, and that he himself would depart shortly <span class="clarity-word">thither.</span></p>
    <p id="acts-25_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with <span class="clarity-word">me,</span> and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Cæsarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Cæsar, have I offended any thing at all.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</p>

    <p id="acts-25_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Cæsar.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Cæsar? unto Cæsar shalt thou go.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Cæsarea to salute Festus.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed <span class="clarity-word">me,</span> desiring <span class="clarity-word">to have</span> judgment against him.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked <span class="clarity-word">him</span> whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Cæsar.</p>

    <p id="acts-25_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and <span class="clarity-word">also</span> here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</p>
    <p id="acts-25_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</p>

    <p id="acts-26_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</p>

    <p id="acts-26_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</p>

    <p id="acts-26_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill <span class="clarity-word">me.</span></p>

    <p id="acts-27_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, <span class="clarity-word">and there</span> to winter; <span class="clarity-word">which is</span> an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained <span class="clarity-word">their</span> purpose, loosing <span class="clarity-word">thence,</span> they sailed close by Crete.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let <span class="clarity-word">her</span> drive.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next <span class="clarity-word">day</span> they lightened the ship;</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>And the third <span class="clarity-word">day</span> we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on <span class="clarity-word">us,</span> all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of <span class="clarity-word">any man’s</span> life among you, but of the ship.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Cæsar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And sounded, and found <span class="clarity-word">it</span> twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found <span class="clarity-word">it</span> fifteen fathoms.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought <span class="clarity-word">them</span> all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>Wherefore I pray you to take <span class="clarity-word">some</span> meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> he began to eat.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took <span class="clarity-word">some</span> meat.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p38" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38 </span>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p39" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39 </span>And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p40" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40 </span>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed <span class="clarity-word">themselves</span> unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p41" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41 </span>And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p42" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42 </span>And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p43" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43 </span>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from <span class="clarity-word">their</span> purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast <span class="clarity-word">themselves</span> first <span class="clarity-word">into the sea,</span> and get to land:</p>
    <p id="acts-27_p44" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44 </span>And the rest, some on boards, and some on <span class="clarity-word">broken pieces</span> of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</p>

    <p id="acts-28_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid <span class="clarity-word">them</span> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And when the barbarians saw the <span class="clarity-word">venomous</span> beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <span class="clarity-word">us</span> with such things as were necessary.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <span class="clarity-word">there</span> three days.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <span class="clarity-word">and</span> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Who, when they had examined me, would have let <span class="clarity-word">me</span> go, because there was no cause of death in me.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>But when the Jews spake against <span class="clarity-word">it,</span> I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <span class="clarity-word">you,</span> and to speak with <span class="clarity-word">you:</span> because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judæa concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <span class="clarity-word">his</span> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <span class="clarity-word">out of</span> the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <span class="clarity-word">their</span> eyes, and hear with <span class="clarity-word">their</span> ears, and understand with <span class="clarity-word">their</span> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <span class="clarity-word">that</span> they will hear it.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</p>
    <p id="acts-28_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</p>

    <h2 id="romans-1" class="chapter-title">Chapter 1</h2>
    <p id="romans-1_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called <span class="clarity-word">to be</span> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And declared <span class="clarity-word">to be</span> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <span class="clarity-word">to be</span> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <span class="clarity-word">it</span> unto them.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <span class="clarity-word">even</span> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <span class="clarity-word">him</span> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And even as they did not like to retain God in <span class="clarity-word">their</span> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p>
    <p id="romans-1_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p>

    <p id="romans-7_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <span class="clarity-word">was</span> dead.</p>
    <p id="romans-7_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</p>

    <p id="romans-7_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</p>
    <p id="romans-7_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</p>

    <p id="romans-7_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</p>

    <p id="romans-7_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</p>
    <p id="romans-7_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</p>

    <p id="romans-8_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Because the carnal mind <span class="clarity-word">is</span> enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</p>
    <p id="romans-8_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>
    <p id="romans-8_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</p>

    <p id="romans-11_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, <span class="clarity-word">of</span> the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to <span class="clarity-word">the image of</span> Baal.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And if by grace, then <span class="clarity-word">is it</span> no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if <span class="clarity-word">it be</span> of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but <span class="clarity-word">rather</span> through their fall salvation <span class="clarity-word">is come</span> unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Now if the fall of them <span class="clarity-word">be</span> the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>If by any means I may provoke to emulation <span class="clarity-word">them which are</span> my flesh, and might save some of them.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>For if the casting away of them <span class="clarity-word">be</span> the reconciling of the world, what <span class="clarity-word">shall</span> the receiving <span class="clarity-word">of them be,</span> but life from the dead?</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>For if the firstfruit <span class="clarity-word">be</span> holy, the lump <span class="clarity-word">is</span> also <span class="clarity-word">holy:</span> and if the root <span class="clarity-word">be</span> holy, so <span class="clarity-word">are</span> the branches.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p20" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20 </span>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>For if God spared not the natural branches, <span class="clarity-word">take heed</span> lest he also spare not thee.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in <span class="clarity-word">his</span> goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural <span class="clarity-word">branches,</span> be grafted into their own olive tree?</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>For this <span class="clarity-word">is</span> my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>As concerning the gospel, <span class="clarity-word">they are</span> enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, <span class="clarity-word">they are</span> beloved for the fathers’ sakes.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>For the gifts and calling of God <span class="clarity-word">are</span> without repentance.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p31" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31 </span>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p32" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32 </span>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p33" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33 </span>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable <span class="clarity-word">are</span> his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p35" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35 </span>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</p>
    <p id="romans-11_p36" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36 </span>For of him, and through him, and to him, <span class="clarity-word">are</span> all things: to whom <span class="clarity-word">be</span> glory for ever. Amen.</p>

    <p id="romans-12_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, <span class="clarity-word">which is</span> your reasonable service.</p>
    <p id="romans-12_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <span class="clarity-word">is</span> that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>

    <p id="romans-13_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</p>

    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <span class="clarity-word">that ye may be</span> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>God <span class="clarity-word">is</span> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <span class="clarity-word">which are of the house</span> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</p>

    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p18" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18 </span>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</p>

    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p21" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21 </span>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p22" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22 </span>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p23" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23 </span>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p24" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24 </span>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p25" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25 </span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p26" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26 </span>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <span class="clarity-word">are called:</span></p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p27" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27 </span>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p28" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28 </span>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <span class="clarity-word">yea,</span> and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p29" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29 </span>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-1_p30" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30 </span>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</p>

    <p id="1-corinthians-7_p34" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34 </span>There is difference <span class="clarity-word">also</span> between a wife and a virgin.

    <p id="1-corinthians-7_p37" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37 </span>Nevertheless he that standeth steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</p>

    <p id="1-corinthians-9_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</p>

For our sakes, no doubt, <span class="clarity-word">this</span> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</p>
    <p id="1-corinthians-9_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, <span class="clarity-word">is it</span> a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</p>

    <p id="1-corinthians-9_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</p>

    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence <span class="clarity-word">am</span> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>But I beseech <span class="clarity-word">you,</span> that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>(For the weapons of our warfare <span class="clarity-word">are</span> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <span class="clarity-word">is</span> Christ’s, even so <span class="clarity-word">are</span> we Christ’s.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>For <span class="clarity-word">his</span> letters, say they, <span class="clarity-word">are</span> weighty and powerful; but <span class="clarity-word">his</span> bodily presence <span class="clarity-word">is</span> weak, and <span class="clarity-word">his</span> speech contemptible.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <span class="clarity-word">will we be</span> also in deed when we are present.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>But we will not boast of things without <span class="clarity-word">our</span> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>For we stretch not ourselves beyond <span class="clarity-word">our measure,</span> as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <span class="clarity-word">preaching</span> the gospel of Christ:</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>Not boasting of things without <span class="clarity-word">our</span> measure, <span class="clarity-word">that is,</span> of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-10_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>To preach the gospel in the <span class="clarity-word">regions</span> beyond you, <span class="clarity-word">and</span> not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.</p>

    <p id="2-corinthians-11_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <span class="clarity-word">you as</span> a chaste virgin to Christ.</p>

    <p id="2-corinthians-11_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-11_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>I robbed other churches, taking wages <span class="clarity-word">of them,</span> to do you service.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-11_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <span class="clarity-word">things</span> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <span class="clarity-word">so</span> will I keep <span class="clarity-word">myself.</span></p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-11_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</p>

    <p id="2-corinthians-11_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</p>

    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but <span class="clarity-word">now</span> I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me <span class="clarity-word">to be,</span> or <span class="clarity-word">that</span> he heareth of me.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</p>

    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except <span class="clarity-word">it be</span> that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</p>
    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</p>

    <p id="2-corinthians-12_p19" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19 </span>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but <span class="clarity-word">we do</span> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</p>

    <p id="galations-2_p1" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1 </span>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with <span class="clarity-word">me</span> also.</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p2" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2 </span>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p3" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3 </span>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p5" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5 </span>To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p6" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6 </span>But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed <span class="clarity-word">to be somewhat</span> in conference added nothing to me:</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p7" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7 </span>But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as <span class="clarity-word">the gospel</span> of the circumcision <span class="clarity-word">was</span> unto Peter;</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p9" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9 </span>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we <span class="clarity-word">should go</span> unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p10" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10 </span>Only <span class="clarity-word">they would</span> that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p11" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11 </span>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p12" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12 </span>For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p14" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14 </span>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before <span class="clarity-word">them</span> all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</p>
    <p id="galations-2_p15" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15 </span>We <span class="clarity-word">who are</span> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</p>

    <p id="galations-2_p17" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17 </span>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <span class="clarity-word">is</span> therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</p>

    <p id="galations-3_p8" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8 </span>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, <span class="clarity-word">saying,</span> In thee shall all nations be blessed.</p>

    <p id="galations-3_p16" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16 </span>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</p>

    <p id="jude-1_p4" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4 </span>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p id="jude-1_p13" class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13 </span>Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</p>
